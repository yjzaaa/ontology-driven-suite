`semantica.semantic_extract` extracts structured information from unstructured text: the foundation of every knowledge graph in Semantica:

- `NERExtractor`: named entity recognition with confidence scores and source attribution
- `RelationExtractor`: typed relationship extraction (`founded_by`, `located_in`, and custom types)
- `TripletExtractor`: direct `(subject, predicate, object)` triplet generation for RDF output
- `EventDetector`: event detection with participants, temporal context, and confidence
- Three extraction modes on every extractor: `"pattern"` (no API key), `"huggingface"`, `"llm"`


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites & Setup

**Step 1: Install Dependencies**

```bash
# Basic extraction (pattern methods only)
pip install semantica

# HuggingFace models for advanced NER
pip install semantica[models-huggingface]

# LLM-based extraction (highest accuracy)
pip install semantica[llm-groq]    # or llm-openai
```

**Step 2: Set API Keys** (for LLM methods only)

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_key_here"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key_here"
```

**Step 3: First Extraction**

```python
from semantica.semantic_extract import NERExtractor

# Start with pattern method (no setup required)
ner = NERExtractor(method="pattern")
entities = ner.extract("Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs.")
print(f"Found {len(entities)} entities")
# Output: Found 2 entities

# Upgrade to LLM for better accuracy
from semantica.llms import Groq
import os

llm = Groq(api_key=os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY"))
ner = NERExtractor(method="llm", llm_provider=llm)
entities = ner.extract("Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs.")
```


## Exported Classes

<Tip>
  **`NamedEntityRecognizer`** is the high-level coordinator with confidence thresholding and overlap merging. **`NERExtractor`** is the lower-level implementation. For most use cases, start with `NERExtractor` for simplicity or `NamedEntityRecognizer` for fine-grained control.

## Method Selection Guide

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pattern: No Setup">
    Zero dependencies, no API key required. Uses spaCy rules and regex to match standard entity types.

    | | |
    | :-- | :-- |
    | **Setup** | None: works out of the box |
    | **Cost** | Free |
    | **Accuracy** | Good for standard entity types |
    | **Best for** | Quick prototyping, batch processing, air-gapped systems |

    ```python

    ner = NERExtractor(method="pattern")
    entities = ner.extract("Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in Cupertino.")

    rel = RelationExtractor(method="pattern")
    relationships = rel.extract(text, entities=entities)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="HuggingFace: Custom Models">
    Use any pre-trained or fine-tuned transformer model. Free inference, runs locally.

    | | |
    | :-- | :-- |
    | **Setup** | `pip install semantica[models-huggingface]` |
    | **Cost** | Free (local compute) |
    | **Accuracy** | Excellent for domain-specific NER |
    | **Best for** | Medical NER, custom fine-tunes, no API cost |

    ```python
    from semantica.semantic_extract import NERExtractor

    ner = NERExtractor(method="huggingface")

    # Pass model per-call
    entities = ner.extract(text, model="dslim/bert-base-NER", device="cpu")

    # Biomedical NER
    entities = ner.extract(text, model="d4data/biomedical-ner-all")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="LLM: Best Accuracy">
    Highest accuracy for complex schemas and custom entity types. Requires an LLM API key.

    | | |
    | :-- | :-- |
    | **Setup** | `pip install semantica[llm-groq]` + API key |
    | **Cost** | Depends on provider |
    | **Accuracy** | Highest: handles complex types and context |
    | **Best for** | Production, custom entity types, complex relation schemas |

    ```python
    import os
    from semantica.llms import Groq
    from semantica.semantic_extract import NERExtractor, RelationExtractor, TripletExtractor

    llm = Groq(model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile", api_key=os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY"))

    ner  = NERExtractor(method="llm",  llm_provider=llm, max_retries=3)
    rel  = RelationExtractor(method="llm", llm_provider=llm)
    trip = TripletExtractor(method="llm", llm_provider=llm)

    entities      = ner.extract(text)
    relationships = rel.extract(text, entities=entities)
    triplets      = trip.extract(text)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Fallback Chain">
    Try methods in priority order: guarantees non-empty results even when the preferred method is unavailable.

    ```python
    from semantica.semantic_extract import NERExtractor, RelationExtractor

    # Try LLM first, fall back to pattern on error
    ner = NERExtractor(method=["llm", "pattern"])
    rel = RelationExtractor(method=["llm", "pattern"])

    # Always returns results: safe for production pipelines
    entities      = ner.extract(text)
    relationships = rel.extract(text, entities=entities)
    ```

    <Tip>
      Use fallback chains in pipelines where API availability isn't guaranteed (rate limits, network issues). The first method in the list is always tried first.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Method Availability by Extractor

| Extractor | `pattern` | `huggingface` | `llm` | Notes |
| :----------- | :----------- | :--------------- | :------- | :------- |
| `NERExtractor` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full method support |
| `RelationExtractor` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Also supports `dependency`, `cooccurrence` |
| `TripletExtractor` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Also supports `rules` method |
| `EventDetector` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Pattern and LLM only |

### Method Fallback Chains

For reliability, extractors support fallback chains that try methods in order until one succeeds:

```python
# Try LLM first, fall back to pattern if it fails
ner = NERExtractor(method=["llm", "pattern"])
rel = RelationExtractor(method=["llm", "pattern"]) 
trip = TripletExtractor(method=["llm", "pattern"])

# Always returns results - guarantees non-empty extraction
entities = ner.extract(text)
```

### NER Merge Strategies

`NERExtractor` uses `merge_strategy="fallback"` by default, so a method list remains an ordered fallback chain. To run several methods together, choose one of the explicit strategies below:

| Strategy | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- |
| `fallback` | Return the first non-empty method result. |
| `union` | Keep candidates from any method. Same-label boundary variants are aligned, while distinct labels remain available. |
| `consensus` | Require cross-method support for an offset-aligned candidate. `min_votes` defaults to `2`. |

```python
from semantica.semantic_extract import NERExtractor

ner = NERExtractor(
    method=["spacy", "huggingface"],
    merge_strategy="consensus",
    min_votes=2,
    min_agreement=0.75,  # optional support-ratio requirement
    method_weights={"spacy": 0.8, "huggingface": 1.0},
)
entities = ner.extract(text)

for entity in entities:
    print(entity.metadata["supporting_methods"])
    print(entity.metadata["vote_count"], entity.metadata["agreement"])
```

Consensus counts support against the configured eligible methods, not only methods that emitted a candidate. An empty or failed eligible method is therefore a non-supporting vote. Use `eligible_methods=[...]` to restrict the consensus denominator when the configured methods have different coverage, or use `merge_strategy="union"` for complementary rule extractors. `method_weights` only break an otherwise eligible exact-span cross-label tie; they never turn one method into multiple votes.

Each merged entity includes `supporting_methods`, `vote_count`, `eligible_method_count`, `agreement`, and per-method `method_scores` in its metadata. Consensus treats compatible label aliases such as `PER`/`PERSON` and `ORGANIZATION`/`ORG` as the same vote. It resolves a cross-label conflict only when the final spans are identical, using method weight, vote count, confidence, and a stable label order; nested entities at different spans remain available. `ml` and `spacy` are one backend for both voting and weights, so their weights are interchangeable (conflicting values are rejected). Boundary candidates are matched one-to-one only when their span IoU is at least 0.5 with every existing vote in that candidate; equal-confidence variants prefer the longer span. If a provider omits offsets, Semantica resolves its entity text against whole-word document matches before merging. This keeps repeated mentions with the same text distinct and prevents one broad span from acting as a vote for multiple mentions.

`ensemble_voting=True` is deprecated and maps to `merge_strategy="union"` during migration. Use `merge_strategy="consensus"` when method agreement is required.

Unlike `fallback`, `union` and `consensus` never inject a pattern-derived entity after the configured methods return no candidates. An empty result is therefore meaningful in those strategies.


## Quick Start

```python
from semantica.semantic_extract import NERExtractor, RelationExtractor, TripletExtractor
from semantica.llms import Groq
import os

text = "Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in Cupertino in 1976."
llm  = Groq(model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile", api_key=os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY"))

entities      = NERExtractor(method="llm", llm_provider=llm).extract(text)
relationships = RelationExtractor(method="llm", llm_provider=llm).extract(text, entities=entities)
triplets      = TripletExtractor(method="llm", llm_provider=llm).extract(text)
```

## Extractor Methods

| Method | Returns | Description |
| :------ | :------- | :----------- |
| `extract(text)` | `List[Entity]` / `List[Relation]` / `List[Triplet]` / `List[Event]` | Extract from single text input |
| `extract(texts)` | `List[List[...]]` | Process multiple texts (batch detected automatically) |


## NERExtractor

```python
from semantica.semantic_extract import NERExtractor
from semantica.llms import Groq
import os

# Pattern-based: fast, no API key, good for standard entity types
ner = NERExtractor(method="pattern")
entities = ner.extract("Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in Cupertino.")

# HuggingFace-based: custom models, no API cost
ner = NERExtractor(method="huggingface")
entities = ner.extract(text, model="dslim/bert-base-NER", device="cpu")

# LLM-based: best accuracy, handles complex schemas and custom types
llm = Groq(model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile", api_key=os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY"))
ner = NERExtractor(method="llm", llm_provider=llm, max_retries=3)
entities = ner.extract(text)
```

Output format:

```python
[
    {"text": "Apple Inc.",  "type": "ORGANIZATION", "confidence": 0.98, "start": 0,  "end": 10},
    {"text": "Steve Jobs",  "type": "PERSON",       "confidence": 0.99, "start": 27, "end": 37},
    {"text": "Cupertino",   "type": "LOCATION",     "confidence": 0.97, "start": 41, "end": 50}
]
```

### Custom Entity Types

```python
ner = NERExtractor(
    method="pattern",
    custom_entities={
        "DRUG": ["aspirin", "ibuprofen", "metformin"],
        "GENE": ["BRCA1", "TP53", "EGFR"]
    }
)
```

<Note>
  **v0.5.0 fix:** `NERExtractor(method="llm")` no longer silently falls back to pattern extraction on custom gateways. The `response_format=json_object` parameter is now conditionally omitted for incompatible gateways, with a plain `generate()` + JSON parsing fallback applied automatically.
</Note>

## RelationExtractor

```python
from semantica.semantic_extract import RelationExtractor

rel = RelationExtractor(method="llm", llm_provider=llm, max_retries=3)
relationships = rel.extract(text, entities=entities)
```

Output format:

```python
[
    {"subject": "Steve Jobs", "predicate": "founded",    "object": "Apple Inc.", "confidence": 0.92},
    {"subject": "Apple Inc.", "predicate": "located_in", "object": "Cupertino",  "confidence": 0.89}
]
```

Available methods:

- `"pattern"`: rule-based pattern matching
- `"dependency"`: spaCy dependency parsing
- `"cooccurrence"`: proximity-based co-occurrence
- `"huggingface"`: custom models
- `"llm"`: highest accuracy, requires API key


## TripletExtractor

Generate RDF-ready `(subject, predicate, object)` triplets directly from text:

```python
from semantica.semantic_extract import TripletExtractor

trip = TripletExtractor(method="llm", llm_provider=llm)
triplets = trip.extract(text)
# → [{"subject": "Steve Jobs", "predicate": "founded", "object": "Apple Inc.", ...}]
```

Triplets are suitable for loading directly into a triplet store or knowledge graph.


## EventDetector

Detect events with participants and temporal context:

```python
from typing import List
from semantica.semantic_extract import EventDetector, Event

extractor = EventDetector(method="llm", llm_provider=llm)
events: List[Event] = extractor.extract(text)

for event in events:
    print(f"Event type:   {event.type}")
    print(f"Participants: {event.participants}")
    print(f"Temporal:     {event.temporal}")
    print(f"Confidence:   {event.confidence:.2f}")
```

Output fields per event:

- `type`: event category (e.g. `"founding"`, `"acquisition"`)
- `participants`: list of entities with roles
- `temporal`: date or time reference
- `location`: location entity (when present)
- `confidence`: extraction confidence score


## CoreferenceResolver

Resolve pronoun and alias references to canonical entities before extraction:

```python
from semantica.semantic_extract import CoreferenceResolver

resolver = CoreferenceResolver()
resolved_text = resolver.resolve(
    "Apple Inc. was founded in 1976. The company is headquartered in Cupertino."
)
# "Apple Inc." replaces "The company" for consistent downstream extraction
```


## Batch Processing

All extractors automatically detect batch input and process multiple texts efficiently:

```python
# Batch processing with list input
texts = ["Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs.", "Google was founded by Larry Page.", "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates."]

ner = NERExtractor(method="llm", llm_provider=llm)
batch_results = ner.extract(texts)  # Returns List[List[Entity]]

# Process results
for i, doc_entities in enumerate(batch_results):
    print(f"Document {i}: {len(doc_entities)} entities")
    for entity in doc_entities:
        print(f"  - {entity.text} ({entity.label})")
```

**Batch Input Options:**

```python
# Option 1: List of strings
texts = ["Text 1...", "Text 2...", "Text 3..."]
results = ner.extract(texts)

# Option 2: List of documents with IDs (adds provenance metadata)
documents = [
    {"id": "doc_1", "content": "Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs."},
    {"id": "doc_2", "content": "Google was founded by Larry Page."}
]
results = ner.extract(documents)  # Entities include document_id in metadata
```

## Using All Extractors Together

The standard extraction pipeline: entities → relationships → triplets:

```python
from semantica.semantic_extract import NERExtractor, RelationExtractor, TripletExtractor
from semantica.llms import Groq
import os

llm = Groq(model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile", api_key=os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY"))

ner  = NERExtractor(method="llm",      llm_provider=llm, max_retries=3)
rel  = RelationExtractor(method="llm", llm_provider=llm, max_retries=3)
trip = TripletExtractor(method="llm",  llm_provider=llm, max_retries=3)

entities      = ner.extract(text)
relationships = rel.extract(text, entities=entities)
triplets      = trip.extract(text)
```

## Extraction Method Comparison
