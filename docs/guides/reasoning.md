title: "Reasoning & Rules"
description: "Apply forward-chaining, backward-chaining, Datalog, SPARQL, RETE, temporal interval, and LLM-based reasoning over your knowledge graph — derive new facts, check constraints, and explain inferences."
---

Semantica's reasoning layer encodes domain logic as rules and applies it to your knowledge graph to derive conclusions that no single document states explicitly. Eight complementary reasoning modes — from symbol-rule forward chaining to recursive Datalog and LLM-backed freeform queries — let you choose the right tool for each inference problem without switching frameworks.

## What Is Reasoning?

Reasoning derives implicit knowledge from explicit facts using logical rules. Unlike retrieval, search, or graph traversal, reasoning generates new conclusions that weren't directly stated in your original data.

**Reasoning vs. Retrieval:** Retrieval finds existing information that matches your query. Reasoning applies logical rules to derive new facts that weren't explicitly stored.

**Reasoning vs. Search:** Search matches keywords or semantic similarity. Reasoning uses logical inference to conclude facts like "if A implies B, and A is true, then B must be true."

**Reasoning vs. Graph Traversal:** Traversal follows existing edges between nodes. Reasoning can infer new relationships based on rules — for example, concluding that two entities are related even if no direct edge exists.

## Why Use Reasoning?

**Deriving implicit knowledge.** Documents might state "APT29 uses SUNBURST" and "SUNBURST exploits CVE-2020-10148" separately, but reasoning concludes "APT29 exploits CVE-2020-10148" automatically.

**Identifying patterns.** Rules can detect complex patterns across your knowledge graph — threat actors that share TTPs, suppliers in transitive relationships, or compliance violations that emerge from combinations of conditions.

**Supporting investigations.** Reasoning helps analysts by highlighting non-obvious connections, flagging entities that meet risk criteria, and explaining why conclusions were reached.

**Decision support.** Encode policies, regulations, or business rules as logical statements. Reasoning engines evaluate them consistently and provide audit trails for decisions.

## When To Use / When Not To Use

**Use reasoning for:**
- Complex domains with well-defined logical relationships
- Policy enforcement and compliance checking
- Multi-step inference where conclusions depend on chains of facts
- Situations requiring explainable decisions with audit trails
- Identifying implicit relationships that aren't explicitly stated

**Retrieval may be sufficient for:**
- Finding documents or information that directly answers your question
- Exploratory research where you don't know what patterns to look for
- Simple keyword or semantic searches

**Graph traversal may be sufficient for:**
- Following explicit relationships between entities
- Neighborhood analysis around known starting points
- Path-finding between entities with direct connections

**Reasoning provides additional value when:**
- Your domain has logical rules that can infer new facts
- You need to detect patterns that require multiple conditions
- Decisions must be explainable and auditable
- Implicit relationships are as important as explicit ones

## Key Reasoning Concepts

**Datalog** is a logic programming language based on rules and facts. Facts are simple statements like "parent(tom, bob)". Rules derive new facts: "grandparent(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), parent(Y, Z)". Datalog excels at recursive queries and transitive relationships.

**SPARQL** is a query language for RDF data that can incorporate inference rules. It uses triple patterns to match graph data and can be extended with reasoning to derive implicit triples before querying.

**RETE** is an algorithm for efficiently evaluating many rules against a working memory of facts. It builds a network that avoids re-evaluating unchanged conditions, making it suitable for systems with hundreds of rules or streaming data.

**Rule-based inference** applies "if-then" rules to derive new conclusions. Forward chaining applies all applicable rules to derive everything possible. Backward chaining works backwards from a goal to find the minimal proof.

## How Graph Data Becomes Reasoning Facts

When using `DatalogReasoner.load_from_graph()`, your knowledge graph's nodes and edges are converted into Datalog facts. All predicates and arguments are lowercased:

- A node with type "ThreatActor" and id "APT29" becomes `threatactor(apt29)`
- An edge from APT29 to SUNBURST with type "uses" becomes `uses(apt29, sunburst)`

The reasoning engine treats these facts as the starting point for inference, applying rules to derive new conclusions that get added to working memory.

<Info>
The reasoning module operates over facts you supply directly or load from a `ContextGraph`. Derived facts are added to working memory and are immediately available for further inference in the same session. To persist derived facts back into the graph, pass them to `AgentContext.store()`.

## Choosing a reasoning mode

| Mode | Best for | Class |
|---|---|---|
| Forward chaining | Materialise all implied facts from ground truth | `Reasoner.forward_chain()` |
| Backward chaining | Prove a specific goal; get the minimal evidence chain | `Reasoner.backward_chain()` |
| Datalog | Recursive traversal of arbitrary depth (supply chains, org graphs) | `DatalogReasoner` |
| SPARQL | Pattern-matching queries over enriched working memory | `SPARQLReasoner` |
| RETE | 100+ rule sets — incremental fact propagation via alpha/beta network | `ReteEngine` |
| Temporal | Allen interval relations between time windows | `TemporalReasoningEngine` |
| Natural language | LLM-backed freeform queries over graph context | `GraphReasoner` |
| Explanation | Translate inference results into human-readable justifications | `ExplanationGenerator` |

## Step 1 — Ground facts and working memory

The `Reasoner` class maintains a set of ground facts and a list of rules. Facts can be added as predicate strings or loaded from a `ContextGraph`. Start with the explicit knowledge your extraction pipeline produced:

```python
from semantica.reasoning import Reasoner, Rule, RuleType

reasoner = Reasoner()

# Ground facts: Predicate(arg) or Predicate(arg1, arg2)
reasoner.add_fact("ThreatActor(APT29)")
reasoner.add_fact("ThreatActor(GAMMA-7)")
reasoner.add_fact("ThreatActor(DELTA-3)")
reasoner.add_fact("Exploits(APT29, CVE-2025-3400)")
reasoner.add_fact("Exploits(GAMMA-7, CVE-2025-1234)")
reasoner.add_fact("Exploits(GAMMA-7, CVE-2025-5678)")
reasoner.add_fact("CriticalVuln(CVE-2025-3400)")
reasoner.add_fact("CriticalVuln(CVE-2025-1234)")
reasoner.add_fact("CriticalVuln(CVE-2025-5678)")
reasoner.add_fact("Targets(APT29, NATOLogistics)")
reasoner.add_fact("Targets(GAMMA-7, NATOLogistics)")
reasoner.add_fact("SuppliedExploits(DELTA-3, GAMMA-7)")
reasoner.add_fact("SectorOverlap(NATOLogistics, CriticalInfrastructure)")
```

These ground facts represent what documents explicitly stated. The rules you add next tell the system what those facts *imply*.

## Step 2 — Forward chaining: materialising derived facts

Forward chaining starts from ground facts and applies every matching rule until no new conclusions can be drawn — reaching fixpoint:

```python
# String-format rules are parsed automatically
# Variables are single uppercase letters or multi-character uppercase words
reasoner.add_rule(
    "IF ThreatActor(X) AND Exploits(X, Y) AND CriticalVuln(Y) THEN HighRiskActor(X)"
)
reasoner.add_rule(
    "IF HighRiskActor(X) AND Targets(X, Z) THEN CriticalTarget(Z)"
)
reasoner.add_rule(
    "IF SuppliedExploits(A, B) AND HighRiskActor(B) THEN HighRiskSupplier(A)"
)

# forward_chain() applies all rules until fixpoint
derived = reasoner.forward_chain()

for result in derived:
    print("{:<40s}  conf={:.0%}  rule={}".format(
        result.conclusion,
        result.confidence,
        result.rule_used.name if result.rule_used else "n/a",
    ))
```

```text
HighRiskActor(APT29)                      conf=100%  rule=Rule 1
HighRiskActor(GAMMA-7)                    conf=100%  rule=Rule 1
CriticalTarget(NATOLogistics)             conf=100%  rule=Rule 2
HighRiskSupplier(DELTA-3)                 conf=100%  rule=Rule 3
```

DELTA-3 is flagged even though no document described it that way — the system traced: DELTA-3 supplied GAMMA-7, and GAMMA-7 exploits critical CVEs. For rules that need priority ordering or graded confidence, use the `Rule` dataclass:

If a rule has side-effecting actions, one concrete activation runs those
actions at most once on a Reasoner instance. Re-running `forward_chain()` is
therefore safe: already-attempted actions are not repeated. Use
`reasoner.reset_action_history()` when you intentionally want to replay them;
`reasoner.clear()` and `reasoner.reset()` also clear the history.

```python
# Higher priority rules fire first; confidence propagates into InferenceResult.confidence
reasoner.add_rule(Rule(
    rule_id="attr-1",
    name="ttp_match_attribution",
    conditions=["ThreatActor(X)", "Exploits(X, CVE)", "CriticalVuln(CVE)"],
    conclusion="HighRiskActor(X)",
    rule_type=RuleType.IMPLICATION,
    confidence=0.92,
    priority=10,
))

reasoner.add_rule(Rule(
    rule_id="attr-2",
    name="supplier_elevation",
    conditions=["SuppliedExploits(A, B)", "HighRiskActor(B)"],
    conclusion="HighRiskSupplier(A)",
    rule_type=RuleType.IMPLICATION,
    confidence=0.85,
    priority=5,
))
```

## Step 3 — Backward chaining: proving a specific goal

Backward chaining tests a single hypothesis by working backward through rules — the right tool when you need a yes/no answer and the minimal evidence chain without deriving every other possible fact first:

```python
# backward_chain() returns an InferenceResult if the goal is provable, None otherwise
result = reasoner.backward_chain("HighRiskSupplier(DELTA-3)", max_depth=5)

if result:
    print("Proved: {}".format(result.conclusion))
    print("Via premises:")
    for p in result.premises:
        print("  - {}".format(p))
    print("Confidence: {:.0%}".format(result.confidence))
else:
    print("Goal not provable — DELTA-3 is not classified as a high-risk supplier "
          "given current facts and rules")
```

```text
Proved: HighRiskSupplier(DELTA-3)
Via premises:
  - SuppliedExploits(DELTA-3, GAMMA-7)
  - HighRiskActor(GAMMA-7)
Confidence: 85%
```

The premises list is the explanation chain — each item is a fact that was necessary to reach the conclusion. Show this to analysts when they ask "why is DELTA-3 classified as high-risk?"

## Step 4 — Recursive inference with Datalog

`DatalogReasoner` handles questions requiring arbitrary-depth traversal — "which actors can transitively reach critical infrastructure?" — using recursive Horn clause rules with semi-naive bottom-up fixpoint evaluation:

```python
from semantica.reasoning import DatalogReasoner

dl = DatalogReasoner()

# EDB (Extensional DB) — base facts; arguments are constants (lowercase)
dl.add_fact("supplied(delta3, gamma7)")
dl.add_fact("supplied(gamma7, apt29_affiliate)")
dl.add_fact("supplied(apt29_affiliate, apt29)")
dl.add_fact("targets(apt29, nato_logistics)")
dl.add_fact("targets(gamma7, nato_logistics)")
dl.add_fact("sector(nato_logistics, critical_infrastructure)")

# IDB (Intensional DB) — recursive rules; uppercase = variable
# Base case: direct supply link
dl.add_rule("reaches(X, Y) :- supplied(X, Y).")
# Recursive case: X reaches Y if X supplies Z and Z reaches Y
dl.add_rule("reaches(X, Y) :- supplied(X, Z), reaches(Z, Y).")

# Derived predicate combining reachability with sector membership
dl.add_rule("sector_exposure(Actor, Sector) :- reaches(Actor, Target), sector(Target, Sector).")
dl.add_rule("sector_exposure(Actor, Sector) :- targets(Actor, Target), sector(Target, Sector).")

# derive_all() runs semi-naive fixpoint until no new facts emerge
dl.derive_all()

# Query with free variables — returns list of binding dicts
exposures = dl.query("sector_exposure(?actor, critical_infrastructure)")
for row in exposures:
    print("CI-exposed actor: {}".format(row["actor"]))
```

```text
CI-exposed actor: delta3
CI-exposed actor: gamma7
CI-exposed actor: apt29_affiliate
CI-exposed actor: apt29
```

DELTA-3 appears even though no document connects it directly to critical infrastructure. Datalog traced the full chain: delta3 → gamma7 → apt29_affiliate → apt29 → nato_logistics → critical_infrastructure.

Bind variables to ask directed questions:

```python
# Which sectors does delta3 have exposure to?
rows = dl.query("sector_exposure(delta3, ?sector)")
for row in rows:
    print("delta3 → sector: {}".format(row["sector"]))
```

Skip manual `add_fact()` calls by loading a `ContextGraph` directly:

```python
from semantica.context import ContextGraph

graph = ContextGraph()
# ... graph populated by AgentContext.store() or extraction pipeline ...
count = dl.load_from_graph(graph)
print("Loaded {} facts from graph".format(count))
```

## Step 5 — SPARQL queries over enriched working memory

After forward chaining has derived new facts, `SPARQLReasoner` prepares SPARQL queries over the enriched working memory with optional inference expansion:

```python
from semantica.reasoning import SPARQLReasoner

sparql = SPARQLReasoner()

# Inference rules expand the SPARQL query before execution
sparql.add_inference_rule(
    "IF ThreatActor(X) AND Exploits(X, Y) AND CriticalVuln(Y) THEN HighRiskActor(X)"
)

query = """
    SELECT ?actor ?cve WHERE {
        ?actor <Exploits> ?cve .
        ?cve   <CriticalVuln> true .
    }
"""

# expand_query() applies inference rules to the query text:
expanded = sparql.expand_query(query)
print(expanded)
```

`execute_query()` is not implemented yet: no triplet-store execution path exists, so it raises `NotImplementedError` rather than returning an empty result set that callers would misread as "no matches". Until execution lands, run the expanded query against your RDF store directly (for example with `rdflib`).

Inspect the expanded query before running it:

```python
# See the query after inference rules are applied
expanded = sparql.expand_query(query)
print(expanded)
```

## Step 6 — RETE engine for large rule sets

`ReteEngine` implements the RETE algorithm — a network of alpha nodes (single-condition matching) and beta nodes (join operations) that avoids re-evaluating unchanged conditions on every new fact. Use it when you have 100+ rules or need incremental fact propagation in a streaming or event-driven setting:

```python
from semantica.reasoning import ReteEngine, Rule, RuleType, Fact

# Define rules as Rule objects — same Rule class used by Reasoner
rules = [
    Rule(
        rule_id="r1", name="port_scan_detected",
        conditions=["PortScan(Source)", "HighFrequency(Source)"],
        conclusion="Scanning(Source)",
        confidence=0.90, priority=10,
    ),
    Rule(
        rule_id="r2", name="c2_beacon_identified",
        conditions=["Scanning(Source)", "BeaconPattern(Source, Dest)"],
        conclusion="C2Channel(Source, Dest)",
        confidence=0.85, priority=8,
    ),
    Rule(
        rule_id="r3", name="lateral_movement_detected",
        conditions=["C2Channel(Source, Dest)", "InternalHost(Dest)"],
        conclusion="LateralMovement(Source, Dest)",
        confidence=0.80, priority=5,
    ),
]

engine = ReteEngine()
engine.build_network(rules)   # compile rules into alpha/beta/terminal node network

# Facts are structured: Fact(fact_id, predicate, [arguments])
engine.add_fact(Fact("f1", "PortScan",      ["192.168.1.50"]))
engine.add_fact(Fact("f2", "HighFrequency", ["192.168.1.50"]))
engine.add_fact(Fact("f3", "BeaconPattern", ["192.168.1.50", "10.0.0.5"]))
engine.add_fact(Fact("f4", "InternalHost",  ["10.0.0.5"]))

# match_patterns() returns Match objects: rule + matched facts + confidence
matches = engine.match_patterns()
print("Rule activations: {}".format(len(matches)))

# execute_matches() fires each matched rule and returns the derived conclusions
conclusions = engine.execute_matches(matches)
for c in conclusions:
    print("Derived:", c)

# Network diagnostics — useful for verifying rule compilation
stats = engine.get_network_stats()
print("Nodes: {total_nodes}  Alpha: {alpha_nodes}  Beta: {beta_nodes}  Facts: {facts}".format(**stats))

# Clear working memory without recompiling the rule network
engine.reset()
```

The rule network is compiled once by `build_network()`. Each subsequent `add_fact()` call propagates incrementally through only the nodes whose conditions it satisfies — not the full rule set — which keeps evaluation cost proportional to the number of new activations rather than the total rule count.

With a Reasoner bound, Rete action side effects are attempted once per rule,
bindings, and matched fact identity. Passing the same match to
`execute_matches()` again still returns the same conclusion, but does not repeat
its actions. Call `engine.reset_action_history()` to replay actions without
clearing working memory. `engine.reset()` and `engine.build_network()` also
clear the action history.

## Step 7 — Temporal interval reasoning

`TemporalReasoningEngine` computes Allen interval relations between time windows, letting you identify whether two events overlap, one contains the other, they meet at a boundary, and so on across your graph:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from semantica.reasoning import TemporalReasoningEngine, TemporalInterval, IntervalRelation

engine = TemporalReasoningEngine()

def dt(value: str) -> datetime:
    return datetime.fromisoformat(value.replace("Z", "+00:00")).astimezone(timezone.utc)

# Encode time windows as datetimes
nightfall  = TemporalInterval(start=dt("2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"), end=dt("2025-03-31T23:59:59Z"))
sandstorm  = TemporalInterval(start=dt("2025-03-15T00:00:00Z"), end=dt("2025-06-30T23:59:59Z"))
frostbite  = TemporalInterval(start=dt("2025-07-01T00:00:00Z"), end=dt("2025-09-30T23:59:59Z"))

relation_ns = engine.relation(nightfall, sandstorm)
relation_nf = engine.relation(nightfall, frostbite)

print("NIGHTFALL vs SANDSTORM:", relation_ns)
# IntervalRelation.OVERLAPS — both active simultaneously in mid-March 2025
# Warrants investigation for shared C2 infrastructure or coordination

print("NIGHTFALL vs FROSTBITE:", relation_nf)
# IntervalRelation.BEFORE — no temporal overlap; likely independent campaigns
```

The 13 Allen relations cover every possible temporal relationship:

| Relation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BEFORE` | A ends before B starts |
| `MEETS` | A ends exactly where B starts (no gap, no overlap) |
| `OVERLAPS` | A starts before B and ends during B |
| `STARTS` | A and B start together; A ends first |
| `DURING` | A is fully contained within B |
| `FINISHES` | A and B end together; A starts later |
| `EQUALS` | A and B are identical intervals |
| `AFTER`, `MET_BY`, `OVERLAPPED_BY`, `STARTED_BY`, `CONTAINS`, `FINISHED_BY` | Inverses of the above |

An `OVERLAPS` or `EQUALS` result between two campaigns attributed to different actors is a signal worth flagging for analyst review — a temporal coincidence is a hypothesis, not a conclusion.

## Step 8 — LLM-based graph reasoning

`GraphReasoner` routes freeform natural language queries through an LLM provider, using the graph as grounded context. Use it for exploratory questions that do not map cleanly to a predefined rule set:

```python
from semantica.reasoning import GraphReasoner
from semantica.context import ContextGraph

# Initialise with any supported LLM provider
gr = GraphReasoner(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")

# Build a knowledge graph
graph = ContextGraph()
graph.add_node("apt29",          "ThreatActor",   "APT29 / NOBELIUM", country="Russia")
graph.add_node("cve-2025-3400",  "Vulnerability", "PAN-OS RCE",       cvss=9.8)
graph.add_node("nato_logistics", "Target",        "NATO Logistics Network")
graph.add_edge("apt29", "cve-2025-3400",  "exploits", weight=0.97)
graph.add_edge("apt29", "nato_logistics", "targets",  weight=0.88)

# GraphReasoner expects {"entities": [...], "relationships": [...]}
raw = graph.to_dict()
graph_data = {
    "entities":      raw.get("nodes", []),
    "relationships": raw.get("edges", []),
}

answer = gr.reason(
    graph=graph_data,
    query="Which threat actors pose the highest risk to NATO infrastructure, "
          "and what evidence in the graph supports that assessment?"
)
print(answer)
```

`GraphReasoner` is well suited for early-stage investigation — when the question is exploratory and you have not yet formalised inference rules. For reproducible, auditable decisions, use `Reasoner` or `DatalogReasoner` instead.

## Step 9 — Explaining inferences in natural language

`ExplanationGenerator` translates any `InferenceResult` (from forward or backward chaining) into a human-readable explanation, a step-by-step `ReasoningPath`, and a `Justification` with supporting evidence:

```python
from semantica.reasoning import Reasoner, Rule, RuleType, ExplanationGenerator

# Run inference first
reasoner = Reasoner()
reasoner.add_fact("ThreatActor(APT29)")
reasoner.add_fact("Exploits(APT29, CVE-2025-3400)")
reasoner.add_fact("CriticalVuln(CVE-2025-3400)")

reasoner.add_rule(Rule(
    rule_id="r1", name="high_risk_actor",
    conditions=["ThreatActor(X)", "Exploits(X, Y)", "CriticalVuln(Y)"],
    conclusion="HighRiskActor(X)",
    confidence=0.92,
))

derived = reasoner.forward_chain()

# detail_level options: "simple", "detailed", "verbose"
gen = ExplanationGenerator(generate_nl=True, detail_level="detailed")

for result in derived:
    exp = gen.generate_explanation(result)
    print("Conclusion:  {}".format(exp.conclusion))
    print("Explanation: {}".format(exp.natural_language))
    print()

    # Step-by-step reasoning path
    path = gen.show_reasoning_path(result)
    print("Reasoning path ({} steps, confidence {:.0%}):".format(
        len(path.steps), path.total_confidence
    ))
    for step in path.steps:
        print("  [{}] {}".format(step.step_id, step.description))

    # Justification with full evidence list
    just = gen.justify_conclusion(result.conclusion, path)
    print("Justification: {}".format(just.explanation_text))
    print("Supporting evidence: {}".format(just.supporting_evidence))
```

```text
Conclusion:  HighRiskActor(APT29)
Explanation: Given the premises: ThreatActor(APT29), Exploits(APT29, CVE-2025-3400),
             CriticalVuln(CVE-2025-3400), we conclude: HighRiskActor(APT29)
             using rule 'high_risk_actor'.
```

Three detail levels control explanation verbosity: `"simple"` gives a one-line summary, `"detailed"` lists premises and the rule name, and `"verbose"` produces a full confidence-annotated narrative.

## Putting it together: a complete reasoning pipeline

A pipeline combining forward chaining, Datalog reachability, and natural language explanations for a threat intelligence graph:

```python
from semantica.reasoning import (
    Reasoner, Rule, RuleType,
    DatalogReasoner, ExplanationGenerator,
)
from semantica.context import AgentContext, ContextGraph
from semantica.vector_store import VectorStore


def run_threat_reasoning(graph: ContextGraph) -> dict:
    """Apply inference rules to a threat intelligence graph."""

    # --- Forward chaining: derive actor classifications ---
    reasoner = Reasoner()

    for edge in graph.find_edges():
        src = edge.get("source", "")
        dst = edge.get("target", "")
        rel = edge.get("type", "related_to")
        if src and dst:
            reasoner.add_fact("{}({}, {})".format(rel.replace(" ", "_"), src, dst))

    for node in graph.find_nodes():
        name  = node.get("name", node.get("id", ""))

Attribution chains in threat intelligence require multi-hop confidence propagation: a TTP match raises the probability of actor attribution, corroborating ASN geolocation raises it further, and a known targeting pattern for the attributed sector raises it to actionable confidence. Each hop is a separate rule with its own confidence weight, and `InferenceResult` carries the propagated value through the chain.

```python
from semantica.reasoning import Reasoner, Rule, RuleType

reasoner = Reasoner()

# SIGINT-derived facts
reasoner.add_fact("C2Beacon(10.0.0.5, AS59796)")
reasoner.add_fact("ASN_Country(AS59796, Russia)")
reasoner.add_fact("TTP(T1566.001, APT29)")           # MITRE ATT&CK mapping
reasoner.add_fact("ObservedTTP(10.0.0.5, T1566.001)")
reasoner.add_fact("TargetSector(10.0.0.5, Aerospace)")

# Three-stage attribution ruleset with confidence ladder
reasoner.add_rule(Rule(
    rule_id="attr-1", name="ttp_match",
    conditions=["ObservedTTP(IP, TTP)", "TTP(TTP, Actor)"],
    conclusion="SuspectedActor(IP, Actor)",
    confidence=0.75, priority=10,
))
reasoner.add_rule(Rule(
    rule_id="attr-2", name="asn_corroboration",
    conditions=["SuspectedActor(IP, Actor)", "C2Beacon(IP, ASN)", "ASN_Country(ASN, Country)"],
    conclusion="CorroboratedActor(IP, Actor, Country)",
    confidence=0.90, priority=5,

reasoner.add_rule(Rule(
    rule_id="attr-3", name="sector_confirmation",
    conditions=["CorroboratedActor(IP, Actor, Russia)", "TargetSector(IP, Aerospace)"],
    conclusion="HighConfidenceAttribution(IP, Actor)",
    confidence=0.95, priority=1,
))

derived = reasoner.forward_chain()
attributions = [r for r in derived if "HighConfidenceAttribution" in r.conclusion]

    print("{:50s}  conf={:.0%}".format(a.conclusion, a.confidence))

#   Premises: ['SuspectedActor(10.0.0.5, APT29)', 'CorroboratedActor(10.0.0.5, APT29, Russia)', ...]

Zero-trust access control decisions can be evaluated at query time by encoding policy as rules and backward-chaining against a specific access request. The proof — or its absence — is the explainable decision record, ready for audit.

If the backward chain fails, the premises list in the partial result tells the analyst exactly which policy condition was not satisfied — far more useful than a generic "access denied" message.

```python
from semantica.reasoning import Reasoner, Rule, RuleType

reasoner = Reasoner()

# Identity and resource facts for the current session
reasoner.add_fact("User(alice)")
reasoner.add_fact("HasMFA(alice)")
reasoner.add_fact("Role(alice, analyst)")
reasoner.add_fact("Clearance(alice, SECRET)")
reasoner.add_fact("Resource(kube-api, tier1)")
reasoner.add_fact("RequiresClearance(kube-api, SECRET)")
reasoner.add_fact("RequiresMFA(tier1)")

# Zero-trust access policy as inference rules
reasoner.add_rule(
    "IF User(U) AND HasMFA(U) AND RequiresMFA(T) AND Resource(R, T) THEN MFASatisfied(U, R)"
)
reasoner.add_rule(
    "IF User(U) AND Clearance(U, C) AND RequiresClearance(R, C) THEN ClearanceSatisfied(U, R)"
)
reasoner.add_rule(
    "IF MFASatisfied(U, R) AND ClearanceSatisfied(U, R) THEN AccessGranted(U, R)"
)

# Backward-chain the access decision
result = reasoner.backward_chain("AccessGranted(alice, kube-api)", max_depth=5)

if result:
    print("ACCESS GRANTED: {}".format(result.conclusion))
    print("Justified by:")
    for p in result.premises:
        print("  - {}".format(p))
else:
    print("ACCESS DENIED — one or more policy conditions not satisfied")
    partial = reasoner.forward_chain()

Drug-drug interaction detection is a natural fit for forward chaining: facts about enzyme inhibition and metabolic pathways are static, the rules about interaction risk are standardised pharmacology, and the output — a `ClinicallySignificantInteraction` derived fact — needs to fire reliably before a prescription is confirmed.

Datalog handles the transitive case: if drug A induces enzyme E1, and E1 metabolises drug B, the full exposure chain can be traced recursively without knowing its depth in advance.

```python
from semantica.reasoning import Reasoner, DatalogReasoner

# Forward-chain: detect clinically significant interactions
reasoner = Reasoner()

reasoner.add_fact("Metabolizes(CYP2C9, Warfarin)")
reasoner.add_fact("Inhibits(Amiodarone, CYP2C9)")
reasoner.add_fact("DrugInPatient(Warfarin)")
reasoner.add_fact("DrugInPatient(Amiodarone)")
reasoner.add_fact("TherapeuticWindow(Warfarin, narrow)")

reasoner.add_rule(
    "IF Inhibits(DrugA, Enzyme) AND Metabolizes(Enzyme, DrugB) "
    "AND DrugInPatient(DrugA) AND DrugInPatient(DrugB) "
    "THEN PotentialInteraction(DrugA, DrugB)"
)
reasoner.add_rule(
    "IF PotentialInteraction(DrugA, DrugB) AND TherapeuticWindow(DrugB, narrow) "
    "THEN ClinicallySignificantInteraction(DrugA, DrugB)"
)

derived = reasoner.forward_chain()
for r in derived:
    if "ClinicallySignificant" in r.conclusion:
        print("ALERT: {}  (conf={:.0%})".format(r.conclusion, r.confidence))
        print("  Rule: {}".format(r.rule_used.name if r.rule_used else "n/a"))

# ALERT: ClinicallySignificantInteraction(Amiodarone, Warfarin)  (conf=100%)

# Datalog: transitive enzyme induction chain
dl = DatalogReasoner()
dl.add_fact("metabolises(CYP3A4, midazolam)")
dl.add_fact("metabolises(CYP3A4, cyclosporin)")
dl.add_fact("induces(rifampicin, CYP3A4)")
dl.add_rule("reduces_exposure(X, Drug) :- induces(X, Enzyme), metabolises(Enzyme, Drug).")
dl.add_rule("reduces_exposure(X, Drug) :- induces(X, Z), reduces_exposure(Z, Drug).")

dl.derive_all()
reductions = dl.query("reduces_exposure(rifampicin, ?drug)")
for row in reductions:
    print("Rifampicin reduces exposure to: {}".format(row["drug"]))

# Rifampicin reduces exposure to: midazolam
# Rifampicin reduces exposure to: cyclosporin

Basel III capital adequacy rules translate naturally into forward-chaining inference rules: each regulatory condition is a fact, each article is a rule, and the capital decision is a derived conclusion. The rule chain is the audit trail — an examiner can inspect exactly which conditions fired and in what order.

Backward chaining is useful for stress testing: "under what conditions would this loan receive a `ConditionalApproval`?" answers by proving the goal and surfacing the minimal set of required facts.

```python
from semantica.reasoning import Reasoner, Rule, RuleType

reasoner = Reasoner()

# Loan application facts
reasoner.add_fact("Loan(LOAN-2025-88421)")
reasoner.add_fact("LTV(LOAN-2025-88421, 0.78)")
reasoner.add_fact("PD(LOAN-2025-88421, 0.023)")
reasoner.add_fact("LGD(LOAN-2025-88421, 0.45)")
reasoner.add_fact("AssetClass(LOAN-2025-88421, CRE)")
reasoner.add_fact("DSCR(LOAN-2025-88421, 1.12)")

# Basel III CRE20 capital rules
reasoner.add_rule(Rule(
    rule_id="cre20-1", name="ltv_rwa_bucket",
    conditions=["Loan(L)", "LTV(L, V)", "AssetClass(L, CRE)"],
    conclusion="RWABucket(L, high)",
    confidence=0.98, priority=10,
))
reasoner.add_rule(Rule(

    conditions=["Loan(L)", "DSCR(L, D)"],
    conclusion="DSCRAdequate(L)",
    confidence=0.95, priority=8,

reasoner.add_rule(Rule(
    rule_id="cre20-3", name="conditional_approval",
    conditions=["Loan(L)", "RWABucket(L, high)", "DSCRAdequate(L)"],

# DSCRAdequate(LOAN-2025-88421)                      [95%]
# ConditionalApproval(LOAN-2025-88421)               [87%]

# Audit: prove the approval decision and show its full justification

## Common Pitfalls

**Overusing reasoning.** Not every query needs inference. If you can answer your question with simple retrieval or graph traversal, reasoning adds unnecessary complexity. Use reasoning when you need to derive facts that aren't explicitly stated.

**Poor graph quality.** Reasoning amplifies data quality issues. If your graph has inconsistent entity names, missing relationships, or incorrect facts, reasoning will propagate these errors. Clean your graph data before applying inference rules.

**Treating inferred facts as verified facts.** Reasoning conclusions are only as reliable as the rules and facts they're based on. An inferred fact like "HighRiskActor(APT29)" reflects your rule logic, not ground truth. Always distinguish between observed facts and inferred conclusions.

**Excessive rule complexity.** Complex rules with many conditions are hard to debug and maintain. Start with simple rules and add complexity gradually. A rule with 10 conditions probably should be broken into smaller, more focused rules.

**Recursive reasoning on large datasets.** Recursive Datalog rules can generate exponential numbers of derived facts on large graphs. Monitor working memory size and add depth limits or termination conditions to prevent runaway inference.
