## What Is Export?

Export converts Semantica graph data into formats used by external tools and systems. Unlike internal persistence mechanisms that keep data within Semantica, export is specifically designed for interoperability with external consumers.

**Export vs. internal persistence:**
- **`AgentContext.store()`** and graph persistence keep data inside Semantica for continued processing, retrieval, and reasoning
- **Export functions** serialize graph data into standardized formats that external systems can consume directly

Export enables integration with analytics platforms, graph databases, RDF triple stores, semantic web systems, data warehouses, business intelligence tools, and downstream consumers that need access to your knowledge graph data in their native formats.

## Why Use Export?

**Build once, export many.** Create your knowledge graph through Semantica's extraction and reasoning workflows, then export the same graph data to multiple formats for different consumers without rebuilding or reprocessing.

**Interoperability with existing ecosystems.** Connect Semantica graphs to established tools and workflows in your organization, from Neo4j graph databases to Gephi visualizations to pandas data analysis pipelines.

**Analytics and reporting workflows.** Feed graph data into business intelligence tools, statistical analysis platforms, and machine learning pipelines that require specific data formats like CSV, Parquet, or RDF.

**Graph database migration and deployment.** Move graphs from Semantica's in-memory representation to production graph databases like Neo4j, ArangoDB, or triple stores for scalable query performance.

**RDF and semantic web integration.** Export to semantic web standards (Turtle, JSON-LD, N-Triples) for integration with ontology tools, SPARQL endpoints, and semantic reasoning systems.

**Data lake and warehouse integration.** Export to columnar formats like Parquet for integration with modern data stack tools including DuckDB, Apache Spark, and cloud data warehouses.

**Compliance and archival workflows.** Generate standardized exports for regulatory submission, long-term archival, and audit trail requirements that mandate specific data formats.

## When To Use / When Not To Use

**Use export when:**
- Integrating Semantica graphs with external systems and tools
- Sharing graph data with teams using different technology stacks
- Building analytics pipelines that consume graph data in downstream processing
- Working with RDF and ontology workflows requiring semantic web standards
- Creating reports, visualizations, and business intelligence dashboards
- Migrating graphs to production databases for scalable query performance
- Meeting compliance requirements for specific data format submissions

**Do not use export when:**
- You simply want to save and reload Semantica state—use built-in persistence mechanisms instead
- Agent persistence and memory continuity are your primary goals
- Internal retrieval, reasoning, and graph operations are sufficient for your use case
- Export would add unnecessary complexity to workflows that operate entirely within Semantica
- You need real-time access to evolving graph data—export creates static snapshots

**Consider internal persistence instead when:**
- Your workflow involves iterative graph building, querying, and reasoning within Semantica
- You need to maintain agent memory, conversation history, and decision tracking
- Graph data will continue to be processed and enriched within Semantica workflows

`export_rdf`, `export_graph`, `export_lpg`, and related functions serialize a `ContextGraph` to any of ten formats in a single call, preserving node types, edge weights, and metadata faithfully. Use them when downstream consumers — triple stores, graph databases, visualization tools, ML pipelines, or spreadsheet auditors — each expect a different format from the same in-memory graph.

<Info>
  All export functions take `graph.to_dict()` as their first argument — the same dict produced by `ContextGraph.to_dict()`. Build the graph once, export it to as many formats as you need without re-serializing. Note that `graph.to_dict()` materializes the entire graph in memory, so very large graphs may require additional memory planning.
</Info>

## Building the Graph to Export

Before the first export, populate a graph. Every example below starts from this shared setup:

```python
from semantica.context import AgentContext, ContextGraph
from semantica.vector_store import VectorStore

vs    = VectorStore(backend="faiss", dimension=768)
graph = ContextGraph()
ctx   = AgentContext(vector_store=vs, knowledge_graph=graph, graph_expansion=True)

ctx.store(
    [
        "APT29 exploits CVE-2024-3400 in PAN-OS to target NATO defense contractors.",
        "CVE-2024-3400 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in GlobalProtect.",
        "HAMMERTOSS is APT29's C2 backdoor using Twitter and GitHub as covert channels.",
    ],
    extract_entities=True,
    extract_relationships=True,
)

graph_data = graph.to_dict()   # single dict, reused across all exports below
```

## RDF Formats — For Triple Stores and Semantic Reasoners

**RDF (Resource Description Framework)** is the foundational data model for the semantic web, representing information as subject-predicate-object triplets. RDF formats are essential for integration with semantic web technologies, ontology tools, and systems requiring formal knowledge representation.

When your consumers are triple stores (GraphDB, Stardog, Apache Jena) or OWL reasoners (HermiT, Pellet), you want RDF. Semantica exports to all five standard RDF serializations through a single `export_rdf` call.

```python
from semantica.export import export_rdf

# Turtle — the human-readable default; best for review and Git storage
export_rdf(graph_data, "threat_graph.ttl", format="turtle")

# N-Triples — one triple per line, no indentation; fastest bulk load into any triple store
export_rdf(graph_data, "threat_graph.nt", format="ntriples")

# JSON-LD — embeds @context; best when downstream consumers speak JSON natively
export_rdf(graph_data, "threat_graph.jsonld", format="jsonld")

# RDF/XML — maximum legacy interop; required by some older OWL tools
export_rdf(graph_data, "threat_graph.rdf", format="rdfxml")
```

The format to reach for depends on your consumer. Turtle is ideal for human review and committing to Git — it is compact and readable. N-Triples is the fastest choice for bulk-loading into a SPARQL endpoint because parsers can stream it line-by-line without buffering the whole file. JSON-LD is the right choice when downstream systems already speak JSON and you want the semantic context embedded in the same payload. RDF/XML exists for compatibility with older tools that predate the other formats.

## Graph Formats — For Gephi, Maltego, and Network Analysis

**Labeled Property Graph (LPG)** formats represent networks with typed nodes and edges that carry attributes and metadata. These formats are optimized for graph visualization tools and network analysis platforms that focus on exploring relationships and structural patterns.

GraphML, GEXF, and DOT are the native formats of graph analysis and visualization tools. They preserve node attributes, edge weights, and type labels, so the graph you built in Semantica renders immediately in Gephi or NetworkX with full attribute data.

```python
from semantica.export import export_graph

# GraphML — widest tool support: Gephi, yEd, NetworkX, Maltego
export_graph(graph_data, "threat_graph.graphml", format="graphml")

# GEXF — richer attribute support in Gephi; better for large attributed graphs
export_graph(graph_data, "threat_graph.gexf", format="gexf")

# DOT (Graphviz) — automated layout and rendering for diagrams in reports
export_graph(graph_data, "threat_graph.dot", format="dot")
```

The GEXF format is worth knowing about if you use Gephi for analyst briefings — it carries dynamic attributes and temporal data that GraphML cannot express. DOT is the right choice when you need Graphviz to auto-layout a graph for embedding in a PDF report or documentation site.

## Neo4j Cypher — For Graph-Pattern Threat Hunting

**Cypher** is Neo4j's declarative graph query language that uses pattern matching to find and manipulate graph data. Cypher exports enable teams to run complex graph queries, pattern detection, and graph analytics using Neo4j's optimized query engine.

When the SOC team wants to run Cypher queries against the graph — finding threat actors that share infrastructure, or tracing multi-hop attack paths — you export to Cypher and load the result into Neo4j Desktop or Memgraph with a single command.

```python
from semantica.export import export_lpg

export_lpg(graph_data, "threat_graph.cypher", method="cypher")
```

The output file contains ready-to-run `CREATE` and `MATCH` statements:

```text
CREATE (:ThreatActor {id: "apt29", name: "APT29", nation_state: "RU"})
CREATE (:Vulnerability {id: "cve-2024-3400", cvss_score: 10.0})
MATCH (a {id: "apt29"}), (b {id: "cve-2024-3400"}) CREATE (a)-[:EXPLOITS {confidence: 0.97}]->(b)
```

Load into Neo4j with `cypher-shell < threat_graph.cypher` or drag the file into Neo4j Desktop's import wizard. From that point, the SOC team can write Cypher queries without touching Python.

## ArangoDB AQL — For Multi-Model Queries

ArangoDB combines graph traversal with document queries and full-text search in a single query language. When your compliance team needs to join the graph against structured regulatory documents, ArangoDB is the right backend.

```python
from semantica.export import export_arango

export_arango(
    graph_data,
    "regulatory.aql",
    vertex_collection         = "regulatory_nodes",
    edge_collection           = "regulatory_edges",
    include_collection_creation = True,    # emits CREATE COLLECTION statements
    batch_size                = 200,       # INSERT statements batched to avoid memory spikes
)
```

The `include_collection_creation=True` flag means the AQL file is self-contained — it creates the collections before inserting data, so you can run it against a fresh ArangoDB instance without any prior setup.

## CSV — For Spreadsheet Audits and Statistical Analysis

**CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** is a simple tabular format universally supported by spreadsheet applications, statistical tools, and data analysis platforms. CSV export flattens graph data into rows and columns for teams that work primarily with tabular data.

The compliance team lives in Excel. The data science team lives in pandas. Both of them need CSV. `export_csv` writes the graph as flat rows — entities and relationships as separate files when you pass a base path.

```python
from semantica.export import export_csv

# Single CSV — nodes and edges interleaved with a "record_type" column
export_csv(graph_data, "threat_graph.csv")

# Split CSV — writes threat_graph_entities.csv and threat_graph_relationships.csv
export_csv(
    {"entities": graph_data.get("nodes", []),
     "relationships": graph_data.get("edges", [])},
    "threat_graph",
)
```

The split form is more useful for downstream tools: the entities CSV feeds a pivot table of entity types; the relationships CSV feeds a network analysis in pandas or R.

## Parquet — For Data Lakes and ML Pipelines

**Parquet** is a columnar storage format optimized for analytics workloads, offering efficient compression and fast query performance. Parquet files integrate seamlessly with modern data stack tools and machine learning frameworks.

When the data science team runs feature engineering over graph attributes in DuckDB, Spark, or a lakehouse, Parquet is the format they want. It is columnar, compressed, and readable by every major ML framework.

```python
from semantica.export import export_parquet

export_parquet(graph_data, "threat_graph_entities.parquet")
```

Once in Parquet, the graph entities become a DataFrame that can be joined against telemetry, enriched with external features, and fed into classification models — without any custom serialization code on the data science side.

## OWL — For Ontology-Based Reasoning

**OWL (Web Ontology Language)** is a semantic web standard for representing rich ontologies with classes, properties, and logical constraints. OWL enables automated reasoning, consistency checking, and inference over formal knowledge models.

**OntologyGenerator** creates formal ontologies from graph data by analyzing entity types, relationships, and patterns to generate class hierarchies, property definitions, and logical constraints. This enables schema validation, automated reasoning, and integration with semantic web tools.

When you have generated an OWL ontology from your graph using `OntologyGenerator`, you can export it for Protégé, HermiT reasoning, or regulatory submission.

```python
from semantica.export import export_owl
from semantica.ontology import OntologyGenerator

ontology = OntologyGenerator(base_uri="https://example.org/cti/") \
               .generate_from_graph(graph_data)

export_owl(ontology, "cti_ontology.owl", format="owl-xml")
```

## Common Pitfalls

**Confusing export with persistence.** Export creates external snapshots for interoperability, while persistence maintains Semantica's internal state. Don't use export when you need to save and reload agent memory or continue graph-based workflows—use built-in persistence mechanisms instead.

**Exporting stale graph data after graph changes.** Always call `graph.to_dict()` after your final graph modifications. If you store `graph_data` early in your workflow and then modify the graph, exports will reflect the outdated state, not your latest changes.

**Re-running expensive extraction instead of reusing existing graph data.** Build your graph once through entity extraction and relationship inference, then export to multiple formats using the same `graph_data` dict. Don't rebuild the graph for each export format.

**Choosing overly complex formats when CSV is sufficient.** If downstream consumers work with tabular data and don't need graph structure preservation, CSV is simpler, faster, and more universally supported than RDF or GraphML formats.

**Assuming provenance and history automatically appear in exports.** Standard export formats capture the current graph state but don't include provenance chains, version history, or audit trails. Use dedicated provenance export mechanisms if you need full lineage information.

**Ignoring downstream schema requirements.** Different systems expect different identifier formats, attribute schemas, and relationship representations. Validate that your exported data matches the expectations of consuming systems before deploying to production workflows.

**Exporting extremely large graphs without memory planning.** The `graph.to_dict()` operation materializes the entire graph in memory. For very large graphs, monitor memory usage and consider chunking or streaming approaches for resource-constrained environments.

<Tab title="Defense — CTI/Threat">

A CTI team needs the same threat graph in four places simultaneously: a SPARQL endpoint for cross-team queries, Gephi for the analyst briefing, Neo4j for graph-pattern threat hunting, and a JSON-LD feed for the SIEM ingestion pipeline. Four exports, one graph dict.

```python
from semantica.context import AgentContext, ContextGraph
from semantica.vector_store import VectorStore
from semantica.ingest import ingest_file
from semantica.export import export_rdf, export_graph, export_lpg
import os

vs    = VectorStore(backend="faiss", dimension=768)
graph = ContextGraph()
ctx   = AgentContext(vector_store=vs, knowledge_graph=graph, graph_expansion=True)

apt_report = ingest_file("apt29_2024_campaign.pdf", method="file")
ctx.store(apt_report.text, extract_entities=True, extract_relationships=True)

graph_data = graph.to_dict()
os.makedirs("./exports/", exist_ok=True)

# 1. Turtle → SPARQL endpoint (Apache Jena, Stardog, GraphDB)
export_rdf(graph_data, "./exports/threat_graph.ttl", format="turtle")

# 2. JSON-LD → SIEM ingestion (Splunk, Elastic) — JSON-native pipeline
export_rdf(graph_data, "./exports/threat_graph.jsonld", format="jsonld")

# 3. GraphML → Gephi for analyst briefing visualization
export_graph(graph_data, "./exports/threat_graph.graphml", format="graphml")

# 4. Cypher → Neo4j for graph-pattern threat hunting
export_lpg(graph_data, "./exports/threat_graph.cypher", method="cypher")

print("Threat graph exported to 4 formats.")
```

<Tab title="Security — SOC/Incident">

During an active incident the SOC needs the graph in Neo4j for hunting, in GEXF for the Gephi timeline visualization, and in GraphML for import into Maltego. All three from the same in-memory graph.

```python
from semantica.context import AgentContext, ContextGraph
from semantica.vector_store import VectorStore
from semantica.export import export_lpg, export_graph

<Tab title="Life Science — Clinical/Pharma">

Clinical trial data needs to reach a SPARQL endpoint for cross-trial federated queries, a CSV for statistical analysis in R, and a Turtle file for regulatory submission. The graph encodes compound-target-disease relationships extracted from trial protocols.

```python
from semantica.context import AgentContext, ContextGraph

<Tab title="Banking — Risk/Compliance">

A regulatory knowledge graph must reach ArangoDB for multi-model compliance queries, RDF/XML for the long-term regulatory archive, and JSON-LD for the compliance dashboard API. Basel III regulations, risk parameters, and their relationships are all captured as graph nodes.

```python

print("Compliance graph exported in 3 formats.")
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Choosing the Right Format

The format decision usually comes down to who is consuming the output and what tools they already use.

If your consumer speaks SPARQL or uses a triple store, reach for Turtle (human review), N-Triples (bulk load), or JSON-LD (JSON-native pipelines). If they use a property graph database, Cypher goes to Neo4j or Memgraph; AQL goes to ArangoDB when they also need document and search queries in the same system. If they use a graph visualization tool, GraphML is the safest default with the widest tool support, GEXF gives richer attribute handling in Gephi specifically, and DOT is right when you need Graphviz to auto-render a static diagram. If they live in spreadsheets or statistical tools, CSV is the path of least resistance. If they run ML pipelines in DuckDB, Spark, or a lakehouse, Parquet is what they want.

For semantic reasoning and ontology work, OWL/XML is the format — it is the only output that preserves the full class hierarchy for Protégé and HermiT.
