## What Is SHACL Validation?

SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is a standard for validating graph-based data. While an ontology defines the conceptual *schema* (the "what" exists in your domain), SHACL defines the structural *rules and constraints* (the "how" it should be structured). 

In Semantica, `SHACLGenerator` produces constraint rules (shapes) based on your ontology, and the public `run_shacl_validation` function evaluates your actual data against these rules. If a node violates a rule (e.g., missing a required property or using the wrong datatype), a detailed violation report is generated. The historical `_run_pyshacl` name remains available as a compatibility alias.

## Why Use SHACL Validation?

Data validation is critical before running analytics, exporting data, or feeding it into production models. SHACL acts as a **data quality gate** that ensures your graph data is structurally sound. Use it to catch:
- Missing required properties (e.g., a customer without an email address).
- Datatype mismatches (e.g., a string where a number was expected).
- Cardinality breaches (e.g., a person with three primary addresses).

## When To Use / When Not To Use

- **When to Use**: You have a complex, interconnected knowledge graph and need to validate the *relationships* and structural integrity of the nodes across the graph. SHACL excels at ensuring that merged, highly connected data conforms to your business rules.
- **When NOT to Use**: If you are simply validating a flat JSON payload or a single incoming API request. For flat data or single records, use simpler, faster libraries like Pydantic or JSONSchema.

---

## Key Terms Explained

Before diving in, here are a few concepts you'll encounter:

- **RDF (Resource Description Framework)**: A standard way of representing data as a graph. It treats information as connected "triplets" (Subject → Predicate → Object).
- **OWL (Web Ontology Language)**: A language used to build ontologies. It defines the classes and properties that exist in your domain.
- **SHACL Shapes**: The actual validation rules. A "Shape" targets a specific class in your data (like `Person`) and defines the constraints it must follow (like "must have one birthdate").
- **Turtle (.ttl)**: A popular, human-readable file format for storing RDF graph data and SHACL shapes.

---

## Typical Workflow

A typical SHACL validation pipeline follows this lifecycle:

1. **Ontology**: Build an ontology representing your domain.
2. **SHACL Shapes**: Generate shapes from that ontology.
3. **Data Graph**: Prepare your knowledge graph.
4. **Validation**: Validate the knowledge graph against the SHACL shapes.
5. **Violation Report**: Analyze the report for errors.
6. **Remediation**: Fix the data or pipeline and re-validate.

---

## Universal Example: Employee & Department

Let's look at a simple, universally understood example: ensuring every `Employee` belongs to a `Department` and has an `employee_id`.

```python
from semantica.context import ContextGraph
from semantica.ontology import OntologyGenerator, SHACLGenerator, PropertyShape
from semantica.ontology import run_shacl_validation

# 1. Prepare your data graph
graph = ContextGraph()
graph.add_node("emp-1", "Employee", "Alice", employee_id="E001")
graph.add_node("emp-2", "Employee", "Bob") # Missing employee_id, will cause a violation!

# 2. Build the ontology
ontology = (
    OntologyGenerator(base_uri="https://company.example.com/ontology/", min_occurrences=1)
    .generate_from_graph(graph.to_dict(), name="CompanyOntology")
)

# 3. Generate SHACL Shapes
shacl_gen = SHACLGenerator(base_uri="https://company.example.com/shapes/", severity="Violation")
shacl_graph = shacl_gen.generate(ontology)

# Inject mandatory constraints
BASE = "https://company.example.com/ontology/"
for ns in shacl_graph.node_shapes:
    if "Employee" in ns.target_class:
        ns.property_shapes.append(
            PropertyShape(path=f"{BASE}employee_id", min_count=1, severity="Violation")
        )

# Serialize shapes to Turtle
shacl_ttl = shacl_gen.serialize(shacl_graph, format="turtle")

# 4. Prepare your RDF data graph
# (For validation, serialize your graph instances to RDF. Here we use a Turtle string.)
data_ttl = """
@prefix ex: <https://company.example.com/ontology/> .

<http://example.org/emp-1> a ex:Employee ;
    ex:employee_id "E001" .

<http://example.org/emp-2> a ex:Employee .
"""

# 5. Run Validation
report = run_shacl_validation(data_ttl, shacl_ttl)

# 6. Analyze the Report
print(f"Graph conforms: {report.conforms}")
if not report.conforms:
    report.explain_violations() # Populates human-readable explanations
    for v in report.violations:
        print(f"Violation: {v.explanation}")
```

---

Now, let's explore the workflow in more depth.

## Step 1 — Build the ontology from your merged graph

SHACL shapes are derived from an ontology. If you already have one from a previous run, skip this step.

```python
from semantica.context import AgentContext, ContextGraph
from semantica.vector_store import VectorStore
from semantica.ontology import OntologyGenerator

graph = ContextGraph()
ctx   = AgentContext(
    vector_store=VectorStore(backend="faiss", dimension=768),
    knowledge_graph=graph,
    graph_expansion=True,
)

# Load the merged CTI data — in production this would be your full 12,000-node graph
ctx.store(
    [
        "APT29 is a Russian state-sponsored threat actor targeting NATO governments.",
        "CVE-2024-3400 is a critical vulnerability in PAN-OS exploited by APT29.",
        "HAMMERTOSS is a backdoor malware family used by APT29 for C2 over Twitter.",
        "PAN-OS is a network operating system developed by Palo Alto Networks.",
    ],
    extract_entities=True,
    extract_relationships=True,
)

ontology = (
    OntologyGenerator(base_uri="https://cti.example.org/ontology/", min_occurrences=1)
    .generate_from_graph(graph.to_dict(), name="CyberOntology")
)

print(f"Classes inferred: {len(ontology.get('classes', []))}")
# Classes inferred: 4  → ThreatActor, Vulnerability, Malware, Platform
```

---

## Step 2 — Generate SHACL shapes from the ontology

`SHACLGenerator` produces a `SHACLGraph` with one `NodeShape` per OWL class.

```python
from semantica.ontology import SHACLGenerator

shacl_gen = SHACLGenerator(
    base_uri="https://cti.example.org/shapes/",
    include_inherited=True,   # propagate parent-class constraints to sub-classes
    severity="Violation",     # default severity for all generated shapes
    quality_tier="standard",  # constraint strictness: "minimal" | "standard" | "strict"
)

shacl_graph = shacl_gen.generate(ontology)

print(f"Node shapes generated: {len(shacl_graph.node_shapes)}")
# Node shapes generated: 4  — one per class

for ns in shacl_graph.node_shapes:
    print(f"  {ns.target_class}  ({len(ns.property_shapes)} property constraints)")
# https://cti.example.org/ontology/ThreatActor   (2 property constraints)
# https://cti.example.org/ontology/Vulnerability  (3 property constraints)
# https://cti.example.org/ontology/Malware        (2 property constraints)
# https://cti.example.org/ontology/Platform       (1 property constraint)
```

The generated shapes tell you what the pipeline observed. They do not yet encode what your domain *requires*. The next section shows how to inject domain-specific mandatory constraints.

---

## Step 3 — Inject domain constraints

Add mandatory `PropertyShape` constraints the pipeline cannot infer from data alone.

```python
from semantica.ontology import PropertyShape

BASE = "https://cti.example.org/ontology/"

for node_shape in shacl_graph.node_shapes:

    if "Malware" in node_shape.target_class:
        # family is required — missing it causes a Violation
        node_shape.property_shapes.append(
            PropertyShape(
                path=f"{BASE}family",
                min_count=1,
                severity="Violation",
            )
        )
        # attribution_confidence is recommended — missing it causes a Warning
        node_shape.property_shapes.append(
            PropertyShape(
                path=f"{BASE}attribution_confidence",
                min_count=1,
                datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float",
                severity="Warning",
            )
        )

    if "Vulnerability" in node_shape.target_class:
        # cvss_score is required by your detection rules
        node_shape.property_shapes.append(
            PropertyShape(
                path=f"{BASE}cvss_score",
                min_count=1,
                datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float",
                severity="Violation",
            )
        )

    if "ThreatActor" in node_shape.target_class:
        # name is required; nation_state classification is recommended
        node_shape.property_shapes.append(
            PropertyShape(path=f"{BASE}name",         min_count=1, severity="Violation")
        )
        node_shape.property_shapes.append(
            PropertyShape(path=f"{BASE}nation_state",  min_count=1, severity="Warning")
        )

# Serialise the final shape graph to Turtle for reuse and version control
shacl_ttl = shacl_gen.serialize(shacl_graph, format="turtle")

with open("cti_shapes.ttl", "w") as f:
    f.write(shacl_ttl)

print("Shapes written to cti_shapes.ttl")
```

You can also construct shapes manually from scratch — useful when you need to express constraints the generator would never infer, such as a regex pattern on a CVE ID field:

```python
from semantica.ontology import NodeShape, PropertyShape, SHACLGraph

# Require CVE IDs to match the canonical NIST format
cve_id_shape = NodeShape(
    target_class="https://cti.example.org/ontology/Vulnerability",
    name="VulnerabilityShape",
    closed=False,
    severity="Violation",
    property_shapes=[
        PropertyShape(
            path="https://cti.example.org/ontology/cve_id",
            min_count=1,
            pattern=r"^CVE-\d{4}-\d{4,}$",   # e.g. CVE-2024-3400
            severity="Violation",
        ),
    ],
)
# Inject into the existing shacl_graph or build a standalone SHACLGraph
```

---

## Step 4 — Run validation and read the report

Serialize the graph to RDF, then run `run_shacl_validation` against the shapes.

```python
from semantica.ontology import run_shacl_validation

# Prepare your RDF data string (since export_rdf primarily exports structural metadata,
# you typically serialize your custom data graph to Turtle using rdflib or similar).
data_ttl = """
@prefix ex: <https://cti.example.org/ontology/> .

<http://example.org/malware-002> a ex:Malware .
<http://example.org/vuln-003> a ex:Vulnerability ;
    ex:cve_id "CVE24-3400" .
"""

# Run SHACL validation
report = run_shacl_validation(
    data_ttl,
    shacl_ttl,
    data_graph_format="turtle",
    shacl_format="turtle",
)

# High-level summary
print(f"Conforms   : {report.conforms}")
# Conforms   : False   ← at least one Violation found

print(f"Violations : {report.violation_count}")
# Violations : 3

print(f"Warnings   : {report.warning_count}")
# Warnings   : 2

print(report.summary())
# Graph does NOT conform: 3 violation(s).
```

The summary tells you something is wrong. Now drill into the details.

---

## Step 5 — Understand the violations

Each `SHACLViolation` identifies the node, property path, and fix required.

```python
if not report.conforms:
    # Populate plain-English explanations for every violation
    report.explain_violations()
    
    # Iterate and print the explanations
    for v in report.violations:
        print(v.explanation)
    # Node <http://example.org/malware-002> is missing required property
    #   <https://cti.example.org/ontology/family>. At least 1 value(s) are required.
    # Node <http://example.org/vuln-003> is missing required property
    #   <https://cti.example.org/ontology/cvss_score>. At least 1 value(s) are required.
    # Node <http://example.org/vuln-003> has value 'CVE24-3400' for
    #   <https://cti.example.org/ontology/cve_id> which does not match the required pattern.

    # Iterate for programmatic triage
    for v in report.violations:
        print(f"VIOLATION  node={v.focus_node}")
        print(f"           path={v.result_path}")
        print(f"           rule={v.constraint}")
        print(f"           msg ={v.message}")
        if v.value:
            print(f"           val ={v.value}")
        if v.explanation:
            print(f"           fix ={v.explanation}")
        print()

    # Warnings are lower severity — review but do not block
    for w in report.warnings:
        print(f"WARNING  {w.focus_node}  {w.result_path}  {w.message}")
```

The output maps directly to remediation tasks: `malware-002` needs a `family` property added; `vuln-003` needs a `cvss_score` and its `cve_id` corrected to the canonical format.

---

## Step 6 — Auto-remediate common violations

Flag or patch nodes missing required properties, then re-validate to confirm.

```python
# Parse the report into a dict for programmatic processing
report_dict = report.to_dict()

# Collect nodes missing the 'family' property
missing_family = [
    v["focus_node"]
    for v in report_dict.get("violations", [])
    if "family" in (v.get("result_path") or "")
]

print(f"Malware nodes missing 'family': {len(missing_family)}")
# In production: queue these for analyst enrichment or apply a default
# e.g. graph.update_node(node_id, {"family": "UNKNOWN — requires triage"})

# After remediation, re-run validation to confirm the fix
# (re-export the patched graph to Turtle first, then call run_shacl_validation again)
report2 = run_shacl_validation(patched_data_ttl, shacl_ttl)
print(f"Violations after remediation: {report2.violation_count}")
# Violations after remediation: 0
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Assuming the ontology automatically enforces data quality**: `SHACLGenerator` generates shapes based on what it observes in the data. If your data is missing a field, the generator won't know it was mandatory unless you explicitly inject the constraint (as shown in Step 3).
- **Passing `ContextGraph` directly to SHACL validators**: The `run_shacl_validation` function expects an RDF string (like Turtle format), not a raw Python dictionary or `ContextGraph` object.
- **Forgetting RDF serialization**: You must serialize your graph (often via a temporary file using `export_rdf`) before validating it.
- **Treating validation as a one-time step**: Validation should be integrated as an automated step in your CI/CD pipeline or data ingestion flow, acting as a recurring gatekeeper rather than a one-off script.
- **Ignoring validation reports**: A graph that does not conform must be remediated. Failing to review the `violation_count` and address the issues negates the purpose of SHACL validation.
- **Validating `sh:class`/`sh:node` range checks on a property that declares `rdfs:range` with RDFS entailment on**: RDFS is an entailment rule, not a constraint. When pyshacl runs with `inference="rdfs"`, it infers the range class onto every object of the property, so class-based constraints on that property can never fail — the report says `conforms: True` on data that does not conform:

    ```python
    from pyshacl import validate
    from rdflib import Graph

    data = Graph()
    data.parse(
        data="""
        @prefix ex: <https://example.org/ns#> .
        @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
        ex:contains rdfs:domain ex:Container ; rdfs:range ex:Item .
        ex:box a ex:Container ; ex:contains ex:notAnItem .
        ex:notAnItem a ex:Fish .
        """,
        format="turtle",
    )

    shapes = Graph()
    shapes.parse(
        data="""
        @prefix ex: <https://example.org/ns#> .
        @prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .
        ex:ContainerShape a sh:NodeShape ;
            sh:targetClass ex:Container ;
            sh:property [ sh:path ex:contains ; sh:class ex:Item ] .
        """,
        format="turtle",
    )

    for inference in ("none", "rdfs"):
        conforms, _, _ = validate(data, shacl_graph=shapes, inference=inference)
        print(inference, conforms)
    # none  False   <- correct: notAnItem is a Fish, not an Item
    # rdfs  True    <- the entailment manufactured the type
    ```

    Mitigations: prefer not to declare `rdfs:range` on properties you intend to constrain with `sh:class`; when class membership is the thing under test, run validation without RDFS entailment (`inference="none"`); or express the check as a constraint the entailment cannot satisfy (for example a literal property constraint). Note the trade-off: with entailment off, `sh:targetClass` no longer reaches subclasses, so subclass hierarchies need explicit typing or inference-aware target selection. Semantica's own `run_shacl_validation` wrapper already calls pyshacl with `inference="none"`, so this pitfall only bites when calling `pyshacl.validate` directly with entailment enabled.
- **Trusting `conforms: True` without checking the inference mode**: an inference-enabled run can hide the exact violations the shapes were written to catch (see above). Record which inference mode validation ran under alongside the result, and re-run shape sets that contain `sh:class`/`sh:node` with entailment off before treating a pass as authoritative.

A credit risk team validates every `LoanApplication` node against Basel III CRE20 mandatory fields (`ltv`, `pd`, `lgd`, `asset_class`) before the application enters the credit model. Any missing field is a Violation that rejects the record.

```python
from semantica.context import ContextGraph
from semantica.ontology import OntologyGenerator, SHACLGenerator, PropertyShape
from semantica.ontology import run_shacl_validation

graph = ContextGraph()
graph.add_node("loan-001", "LoanApplication", "Prime mortgage APP-2025-88421",
               ltv=0.78, pd=0.023, lgd=0.45, asset_class="CRE")
graph.add_node("loan-002", "LoanApplication", "SME working capital facility",
               ltv=0.65)
# loan-002 is missing pd, lgd, asset_class — three Violations expected

ontology = (
    OntologyGenerator(base_uri="https://basel.eba.eu/ontology/", min_occurrences=1)
    .generate_from_graph(graph.to_dict(), name="BaselRiskOntology")

## Resource limits

Live SHACL validation in the Explorer enforces four resource limits, all configurable
through environment variables. When a limit trips, the error message names the
variable that controls it.

| Environment variable | Default | What it bounds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SEMANTICA_MAX_SHACL_TURTLE_BYTES` | `262144` (256 KB) | Size of the submitted SHACL Turtle |
| `SEMANTICA_MAX_SHACL_TRIPLES` | `1000` | Triple count of the parsed shapes graph |
| `SEMANTICA_MAX_SHACL_TIMEOUT` | `15.0` | Validation timeout in seconds |
| `SEMANTICA_MAX_SHACL_CONCURRENCY` | `4` | Concurrent validations per process |

The first three are surfaced in the validation error message when exceeded; the
concurrency limit applies as a semaphore and does not appear in responses.

## Using SHACL validation as a CI/CD gate

Call this function as a pre-publish gate; exit code 1 blocks the pipeline.

```python
import sys
from semantica.ontology import OntologyGenerator, SHACLGenerator
from semantica.ontology import run_shacl_validation

def validate_before_publish(data_graph_str: str, ontology: dict) -> None:
    shacl_gen   = SHACLGenerator(base_uri="https://example.org/shapes/")
    shacl_graph = shacl_gen.generate(ontology)
    shacl_ttl   = shacl_gen.serialize(shacl_graph, format="turtle")

    report = run_shacl_validation(data_graph_str, shacl_ttl)

    if not report.conforms:
        print(f"Graph validation FAILED — {report.violation_count} violation(s)")
        report.explain_violations()
        for v in report.violations:
            print(v.explanation)
        sys.exit(1)

    print(f"Graph validation PASSED ({report.warning_count} warning(s))")
```
