Knowledge Graph Builder Module

This module provides comprehensive knowledge graph construction capabilities
from extracted entities and relationships, with full support for temporal
knowledge graphs and advanced graph operations.

Key Features:
    - Build knowledge graphs from entities and relationships
    - Temporal knowledge graph support with time-aware edges
    - Entity resolution and deduplication
    - Conflict detection and resolution
    - Temporal snapshots and versioning
    - Neo4j integration for graph storage

Example Usage:
    >>> from semantica.kg import GraphBuilder
    >>> builder = GraphBuilder(merge_entities=True, resolve_conflicts=True)
    >>> graph = builder.build(sources=[{"entities": [...], "relationships": [...]}])  # doctest: +SKIP

                and ``relationships``.
            second_arg: An optional relationship list or entity resolver kept
                for backward compatibility.
            pipeline_id: Optional pipeline identifier used for progress
                tracking.
            **options: Additional graph-building options:

                - ``extract`` (bool): Whether to run text extraction when a
                  raw string or ``{"text": ...}`` dict is passed as a source
                  (default: ``True``).

                  during text extraction (default: ``True``).
                - ``ner_method`` (str): NER backend used for text extraction
                  (e.g. ``"ml"``, ``"pattern"``, ``"llm"``; default: ``"ml"``).
                - ``relation_method`` (str): Relation-extraction backend

                - ``entity_resolver``: An :class:`EntityResolver` instance
                  that overrides the one configured on the builder.
                - ``relationships`` (list): An explicit list of relationships
                  to include in addition to those found in *sources*.

            Raw-text extraction uses local extractors by default and needs no
            provider or API key. To use LLM extraction, pass the methods
