RDF Export Module

This module provides comprehensive RDF (Resource Description Framework) export
capabilities for the Semantica framework, supporting multiple RDF serialization
formats and validation.

Key Features:
    - Multiple RDF format support (Turtle, RDF/XML, JSON-LD, N-Triples, N3)
    - RDF serialization and export
    - Namespace management and conflict resolution
    - RDF validation and quality checking
    - Batch RDF export processing
    - Knowledge graph to RDF conversion

Main Classes:
    - RDFExporter: Main RDF export class
    - RDFSerializer: RDF serialization engine
    - RDFValidator: RDF validation engine
    - NamespaceManager: RDF namespace management

Example Usage:
    >>> from semantica.export import RDFExporter
    >>> exporter = RDFExporter()
    >>> exporter.export(data, "output.ttl", format="turtle")
    >>> validation = exporter.validate_rdf(data)
