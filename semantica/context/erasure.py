"""
Cross-store erasure coordination.

``ContextGraph.purge_node()`` is graph-scope by design (#957): it removes the
node and leaves a tombstone, but any copy of the same content held in
``AgentMemory`` or in a bound vector store is untouched. That makes purge one
step of an erasure workflow rather than the whole of it, and leaves the caller
to drive the remaining steps by hand -- with no record of which of them
actually succeeded.

:class:`ErasureCoordinator` drives the cascade across the stores it is given
and returns an :class:`ErasureReceipt` describing what was reached and what was
not. It *composes* the existing public APIs; nothing in ``context_graph.py`` or
``agent_memory.py`` changes, and ``ContextGraph`` keeps its graph-scope
contract.

The property that matters is honest partial reporting. FAISS Flat indices now
expose ``delete_vectors`` backed by native ``remove_ids``, so erasure is
completable on them.  FAISS IVF indices explicitly reject deletion because
their internal labels are not compacted after ``remove_ids``, which would
desynchronize search results from the ``vector_ids`` mapping.  HNSW does not
implement ``remove_ids`` at all.  Both IVF and HNSW report ``unsupported``.
Milvus and Weaviate are also fully supported. The receipt says ``unsupported``
rather than reporting a success it did not achieve -- a receipt that reads
"graph: erased, memory: 14 erased, vectors: unsupported on faiss/hnsw" is
actionable; a bare ``True`` is a compliance liability.

Example:
    >>> from semantica.context import ContextGraph, AgentMemory
    >>> from semantica.context.erasure import ErasureCoordinator
    >>> coordinator = ErasureCoordinator(graph=graph, memory=memory)
    >>> receipt = coordinator.erase_entity(
    ...     "customer-4471", reason="GDPR Art. 17 request #882"
    ... )
    >>> receipt.complete
    True
    >>> receipt.stores["vectors"]["status"]
    'not_configured'

class ErasureCoordinator:
    """Drives erasure of an entity across the graph, memory and vector stores.

    Every store is optional; a store that is not supplied reports
    ``not_configured`` rather than being silently skipped, so the receipt still
    shows the full shape of the workflow.

    Args:
        graph: A :class:`~semantica.context.ContextGraph` (or anything exposing
            ``purge_node``).
        memory: An :class:`~semantica.context.AgentMemory` (or anything
            exposing ``find_by_entity`` and ``batch_delete``).
        vector_store: Vector store holding entity-keyed embeddings. Defaults to
            ``memory.vector_store`` when a memory is supplied, and stays
            overridable for deployments that bind a store the memory does not
            own. Pass ``False`` to disable the vector leg entirely.

    Note:
        Erasure runs outward-in -- vectors, then memory, then the graph. The
        graph tombstone is the durable attestation that an erasure happened, so
        writing it first would let a crash mid-cascade leave a record claiming
        more than actually occurred. Erasing the graph last means a partial
        failure leaves the node present and the receipt incomplete, which is
        recoverable and honest.

    Note:
        An explicit ``vector_store=False`` also suppresses ``AgentMemory``'s
        own internal vector cascade, not just the coordinator's leg (#1378).
        ``AgentMemory.delete_memory()`` deletes an item's vectors best-effort:
        it catches a vector-store failure, logs it, and still returns ``True``,
        so without this a caller who opted out of the vector leg could still
        have ``memory.vector_store`` mutated underneath them while the receipt
        read ``vectors: not_configured``. ``vector_store=False`` is taken to
        mean "no vector activity at all", so the coordinator passes
        ``skip_vector=True`` through to ``memory.batch_delete()`` in that case,
        and ``receipt.stores["vectors"]["status"]`` stays ``"not_configured"``
        honestly -- the caller opted the vector store out entirely, rather than
        the coordinator having erased it. This only applies when
        ``vector_store=False`` was passed explicitly; when no vector store
        exists anywhere (no ``memory`` was supplied, or ``memory`` has no
        ``vector_store`` attribute), there is nothing to suppress and
        ``memory.batch_delete()`` is called as before.
