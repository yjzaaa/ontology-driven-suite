# Semantica Knowledge Explorer

A browser-based graph workbench for the [Semantica](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica) platform. Pan and zoom live graphs, scrub the timeline, trace every decision's causal chain, resolve duplicates, and author your ontology visually. Built on React 19 + Sigma.js.

---

## Requirements

| Dependency | Minimum version |
| --- | --- |
| Python | 3.8+ |
| Node.js | 18.x or higher (20.x recommended) |
| npm | 9.x or higher |

```bash
python --version
node --version
npm --version
```

---

## Two ways to run the Explorer

### Option A — pip install (recommended for users)

Install the package with the explorer extras. The pre-built frontend bundle is included in the wheel so no Node.js is required.

```bash
pip install "semantica[explorer]"
```

Launch the dashboard by pointing it at any graph JSON file:

```bash
semantica-explorer --graph my_graph.json
```

The server starts at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and opens the dashboard in your default browser automatically.

CLI flags:

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--graph` / `-g` | *(required)* | Path to a ContextGraph JSON file |
| `--port` / `-p` | `8000` | Port to bind the server to |
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | Host to bind (use `127.0.0.1` for local-only; see security note below) |
| `--no-browser` | off | Skip opening the browser automatically |

Examples:

```bash
# Default — opens at http://127.0.0.1:8000
semantica-explorer --graph my_graph.json

# Custom port
semantica-explorer --graph my_graph.json --port 8080

# Suppress auto-open
semantica-explorer --graph my_graph.json --no-browser

# Equivalent using python -m
python -m semantica.explorer --graph my_graph.json
```

> **Security note:** Since v0.6.5 the Explorer API requires an API key on protected routes. Set the `SEMANTICA_API_KEY` environment variable and send it as the `X-API-Key` header; without a configured key, protected routes fail closed with `503` rather than serving anonymously. To opt into unauthenticated access for local development only, set `SEMANTICA_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=true` explicitly. (`/api/health` and `/api/info` are intentionally unauthenticated.)
>
> The default `--host 127.0.0.1` binds to localhost only, so it is not reachable from other machines on your network. If you bind to `0.0.0.0`, all graph data is readable and writable by any host that can reach the port (subject to API-key auth). The CLI prints a warning when binding to a non-loopback host in anonymous mode or when `SEMANTICA_API_KEY` is unset.

---

### Option B — run from source (for contributors / frontend development)

This mode runs the React dev server with hot module replacement, so frontend changes appear in the browser instantly without rebuilding.

#### Step 1 — Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica.git
cd semantica
```

#### Step 2 — Install the Python package

```bash
pip install -e ".[explorer]"
```

#### Step 3 — Install frontend dependencies

```bash
cd explorer
npm ci
```

#### Step 4 — Start the Python backend

Open a terminal in the repo root:

```bash
semantica-explorer --graph path/to/my_graph.json --no-browser
```

This starts the API on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Keep this terminal open.

#### Step 5 — Start the frontend dev server

Open a second terminal in `explorer/`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite starts on **`http://localhost:5173`**. Open that URL in your browser. All `/api` and `/ws` requests are automatically proxied to the Python backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

---

## Building the production bundle

If you need to serve the UI from the Python server directly (without the Vite dev server):

```bash
cd explorer
npm ci
npm run build
```

This writes the compiled assets to `../semantica/static/`. The Python server then serves the full dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` — no separate Vite process needed.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EXPLORER_CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173` | Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins |
| `EXPLORER_CORS_CREDENTIALS` | `false` | Set to `true` to allow credentialed cross-origin requests (only needed behind an authenticating reverse proxy) |
| `SEMANTICA_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | API key required on protected routes since v0.6.5; send it as the `X-API-Key` header. When unset, protected routes fail closed with `503`. |
| `SEMANTICA_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS` | `false` | Set to `true` to opt into unauthenticated access (local development only). |

---

## Available scripts

Run these from inside the `explorer/` directory:

```bash
# Start the dev server with hot module replacement
npm run dev

# Type-check and build the production bundle into ../semantica/static/
npm run build

# Preview the production build locally
npm run preview

# Run ESLint over all source files
npm run lint

# Run the graph store multi-edge unit tests
npm run test:graph-store

# Run the graph workspace display tests
npm run test:graph-workspace
```

---

## API & WebSocket proxy (dev mode only)

During development, Vite forwards requests automatically — no CORS configuration needed:

| Pattern | Forwarded to |
| --- | --- |
| `/api/*` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/*` |
| `/ws/*` | `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/*` |

To run the backend on a different port, update `server.proxy` in [vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts).

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows a blank white page or "UI not available" message

The frontend bundle is missing from the server's static directory. Fix options:

- **If you installed via pip:** `pip install --upgrade "semantica[explorer]"` — the wheel includes the pre-built bundle.
- **If you installed from source:** run `cd explorer && npm ci && npm run build` from the repo root, then restart the server.
- **In dev mode:** use the Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173` instead of the backend URL.

### Blank graph / no data loads in the browser

- Confirm the Python backend is running and check the terminal for errors.
- Open browser DevTools → Network tab and look for failed `/api/graph` requests.
- If the backend is on a different port, update `server.proxy` in `vite.config.ts`.

### `npm ci` fails or reports missing lockfile

The `package-lock.json` must be present. Run `npm install` once to generate it, commit it, then use `npm ci` going forward.

### `npm run dev` fails with Node version error

Vite 6 requires **Node 18 or higher**. Run `node --version` to check. If you're on Node 16, upgrade via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or the official Node.js installer.

### Port 5173 already in use

Vite automatically tries the next available port and prints the actual URL in the terminal. Use the URL shown in the output.

### WebSocket not connecting (real-time mutations not appearing)

- Confirm the backend exposes the `/ws/graph-updates` WebSocket endpoint.
- Check DevTools → Network → WS tab for the connection status and error code.
- Ensure the backend version matches the frontend — mixing major versions can cause protocol mismatches.
- **Authentication:** `/ws/graph-updates` enforces the same API key as the REST routes. Browsers cannot set custom headers on a WebSocket handshake, so pass the key as a query parameter instead:
  ```
  ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/graph-updates?api_key=<your-key>
  ```
  Non-browser clients (native apps, scripts) may send it as the `X-API-Key` header. A missing or incorrect key results in close code `4401`; if `SEMANTICA_API_KEY` is unset and `SEMANTICA_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS` is not `true`, the connection is also rejected. Note that API keys in URLs appear in server logs — prefer the header for non-browser clients.
