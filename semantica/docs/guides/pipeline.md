description: "Build end-to-end data processing workflows with the PipelineBuilder DSL — ingest, extract, normalize, embed, and store in a single declarative pipeline."
---

`PipelineBuilder` solves the glue problem between processing steps. Declare your steps, register handler functions, wire the connections, and hand control to `ExecutionEngine` — it handles topological ordering, passes output between steps, retries on failure with configurable backoff, and returns a structured `ExecutionResult` you can log or alert on.

## Why Use Pipelines?

Pipelines solve coordination problems in multi-step data processing. Instead of writing monolithic scripts where each function calls the next, you define independent steps and declare their dependencies. The pipeline engine figures out the execution order, runs independent steps in parallel, and passes data between steps automatically.

This becomes essential when you have:
- Multiple data sources that need different processing
- Steps that can run concurrently
- Complex retry or error recovery requirements
- Workflows that change frequently
- Team environments where different people own different steps

A five-step pipeline with two parallel branches executes faster than a linear script, and adding a sixth step requires only declaring where it fits in the DAG.

## When To Use / When Not To Use

**Use pipelines for:**
- Multi-step ETL workflows with 3+ processing stages
- Scheduled production jobs that run daily or hourly
- Workflows where some steps can run in parallel
- Complex data transformations that benefit from modular design
- Team environments where different people maintain different steps

**Don't use pipelines for:**
- One-off scripts or prototypes (use simple functions instead)
- Linear workflows with only 1-2 steps
- Exploratory data analysis in Jupyter notebooks
- Cases where the overhead of defining steps exceeds the workflow complexity

## Typical Pipeline Workflow

Most data pipelines follow a four-stage pattern regardless of domain:

1. **Ingest** — Pull data from files, APIs, databases, or streams
2. **Transform** — Clean, validate, normalize, and enrich the raw data
3. **Extract** — Run entity recognition, relationship extraction, or other NLP tasks
4. **Store** — Write results to vector stores, knowledge graphs, or output files

Each stage can have multiple parallel steps. For example, the Ingest stage might fetch from three different REST APIs simultaneously, while Transform applies different cleaning rules to each source.

<Info>
  `PipelineBuilder` and `ExecutionEngine` are in `semantica.pipeline`. Failure handling, retry policies, and parallelism management are separate classes you can import individually for fine-grained control. Custom step handlers are plain Python functions — no subclassing required.

## Your First Pipeline

The minimum viable pipeline has three steps: ingest, extract, store. Define them, connect them, build, execute.

Every step is a function that takes `data` as the first positional argument and receives step configuration as keyword arguments. The pipeline engine calls your step handler with the upstream data (from dependencies) and passes any step configuration as `**kwargs`:

```python
def handler(data, **config):
    # data contains outputs from all upstream dependencies
    # config contains any parameters passed to add_step()
    processed_data = transform_logic(data, config.get("param1", "default"))
    return processed_data  # Always return data for downstream steps
```

Root steps (no dependencies) receive `None` as their `data` parameter — they generate data from scratch rather than transforming upstream outputs.

Pass the handler function directly to `add_step()` as the `handler` keyword argument, alongside any step configuration:

```python
builder.add_step("extract_step", "ner_extract", handler=extract_entities_handler)
builder.connect_steps("ingest_step", "extract_step")
```

```python
from semantica.pipeline import PipelineBuilder, ExecutionEngine
from semantica.ingest import ingest_file
from semantica.context import AgentContext, ContextGraph
from semantica.vector_store import VectorStore

# --- Define handler functions ---
# The engine calls handler(data, **step_config), so the first positional
# argument is always the upstream data; step config arrives as kwargs.

def ingest_stix_bundles(data, **config):
    # Root step — data is None, generate data from config
    files = ingest_file(config["path"], method="directory")
    return [f.text for f in files if f.file_type == "json"]

def extract_entities(data, **config):
    # data is the output from the previous step
    threshold = config.get("confidence_threshold", 0.7)
    results = []
    for text in data:
        # Your NER logic here — simplified for illustration
        results.append({"text": text, "entities": [], "threshold": threshold})
    return results

def build_graph(data, **config):
    graph   = ContextGraph(advanced_analytics=True)
    context = AgentContext(
        vector_store    = VectorStore(backend="faiss", dimension=768),
        knowledge_graph = graph,
    )
    texts = [d["text"] for d in data]
    context.store(texts, extract_entities=True, extract_relationships=True)
    context.save(config["output_path"])
    return {"node_count": graph.stats()["node_count"],
            "edge_count": graph.stats()["edge_count"]}

# --- Build the pipeline ---
# Pass handler= directly in add_step() so each PipelineStep carries its callable.

builder = PipelineBuilder()

builder.add_step("ingest",  "stix_ingest",  handler=ingest_stix_bundles, path="./stix_bundles/")
builder.add_step("extract", "ner_extract",  handler=extract_entities,    confidence_threshold=0.75)
builder.add_step("store",   "kg_build",     handler=build_graph,         output_path="./cti_output/")

builder.connect_steps("ingest",  "extract")
builder.connect_steps("extract", "store")

pipeline = builder.build("cti_pipeline")

# --- Execute ---

engine = ExecutionEngine(max_workers=4, retry_on_failure=True)
result = engine.execute_pipeline(pipeline)

print(f"Success:  {result.success}")
print(f"Output:   {result.output}")   # the final step's return value, e.g. {"node_count": ..., "edge_count": ...}
print(f"Duration: {result.metrics['execution_time']:.2f}s")
print(f"Steps completed: {result.metrics['steps_executed']}")
```

`ExecutionEngine` performs a topological sort of the step graph before executing, so even if you declare steps in the wrong order the execution sequence is always correct. Each step receives the previous step's return value as its `data` argument.

## Reading the ExecutionResult

Every `engine.execute_pipeline()` call returns an `ExecutionResult` dataclass. Check it before assuming success:

```python
result = engine.execute_pipeline(pipeline)

if not result.success:
    print("Pipeline failed. Errors:")
    for err in result.errors:
        print(f"  {err}")
else:
    print(f"Pipeline completed in {result.metrics['execution_time']:.1f}s")
    print(f"Steps run:    {result.metrics['steps_executed']}")
    print(f"Steps failed: {result.metrics['steps_failed']}")
    # result.output  — the return value of the final step
    # result.metadata — {"pipeline_id": "...", "execution_time": float}
```

`result.errors` is a `List[str]` — one entry per failed step, each containing the exception message. A pipeline with `retry_on_failure=True` attempts each failed step up to `max_retries` times (default: 3) before recording it as a failure and moving on.

## Handling Failures and Configuring Retry Policy

By default, `ExecutionEngine(retry_on_failure=True)` uses an exponential backoff policy: three retries, starting at 1 second, doubling each time, capped at 60 seconds. For steps that call external APIs or databases — where transient failures are expected — you can set per-step-type policies via `FailureHandler`:

```python
from semantica.pipeline import ExecutionEngine, FailureHandler, RetryPolicy, RetryStrategy

# Build a custom failure handler
handler = FailureHandler()

# Web/API steps: retry up to 5 times with exponential backoff
handler.set_retry_policy(
    "misp_fetch",
    RetryPolicy(
        max_retries    = 5,
        strategy       = RetryStrategy.EXPONENTIAL,
        backoff_factor = 2.0,
        initial_delay  = 2.0,
        max_delay      = 120.0,
    ),
)

# Database steps: fixed delay, fewer retries (connection pool usually recovers fast)
handler.set_retry_policy(
    "db_ingest",
    RetryPolicy(
        max_retries   = 3,
        strategy      = RetryStrategy.FIXED,
        initial_delay = 5.0,
    ),
)

# NER steps: don't retry — if the model crashes it needs human intervention
handler.set_retry_policy(
    "ner_extract",
    RetryPolicy(max_retries=0),
)

engine = ExecutionEngine(
    max_workers      = 4,
    retry_on_failure = True,
)
# ExecutionEngine builds its own FailureHandler; replace it with the configured one
engine.failure_handler = handler
# The engine now calls engine.failure_handler.get_retry_policy(step.step_type) on failure
```

`handler.classify_error()` distinguishes `ValidationError` (low severity, usually don't retry), `ProcessingError` (high severity), and timeout/connection errors (medium severity, always retry). You can inspect the classification:

```python
try:
    result = engine.execute_pipeline(pipeline)
except Exception as e:
    classification = handler.classify_error(e)
    print(f"Severity: {classification['severity'].value}")   # "high" / "medium" / "low"
    print(f"Message: {classification['message']}")
```

## Running Steps in Parallel

When two steps don't depend on each other — for example, NER extraction and triplet extraction both reading from the same ingest output — declare them as parallel branches by connecting both to the same upstream step:

```python
builder = PipelineBuilder()
builder.register_step_handler("file_ingest",     ingest_stix_bundles)
builder.register_step_handler("ner_extract",     run_ner)
builder.register_step_handler("triplet_extract", run_triplets)
builder.register_step_handler("kg_merge",        merge_into_graph)

builder.add_step("ingest",   "file_ingest",     path="./stix_bundles/")
builder.add_step("ner",      "ner_extract",     confidence_threshold=0.75)
builder.add_step("triplets", "triplet_extract", include_temporal=True)
builder.add_step("store",    "kg_merge",        output_path="./cti_output/")

# ingest feeds both ner and triplets in parallel
builder.connect_steps("ingest",   "ner")
builder.connect_steps("ingest",   "triplets")
# both converge into store
builder.connect_steps("ner",      "store")
builder.connect_steps("triplets", "store")

builder.set_parallelism(2)   # run ner and triplets concurrently

pipeline = builder.build("parallel_extraction")
engine   = ExecutionEngine(max_workers=2, retry_on_failure=True)
result   = engine.execute_pipeline(pipeline)
```

`set_parallelism(n)` tells the engine how many steps it may run simultaneously; `n` must be a positive integer. The topological sort guarantees that only steps whose dependencies are all completed are eligible for concurrent execution — you cannot accidentally run a step before its inputs are ready. The effective concurrency is capped at `min(n, max_workers)`, so the engine's `max_workers` setting remains a hard resource ceiling.

Concurrency is opt-in per step. A dependency layer only runs in parallel when every step in that layer is marked `parallel_safe`, the layer has more than one step, and the data flowing into the layer is a dict:

```python
builder.add_step("ner",      "ner_extract",     parallel_safe=True, confidence_threshold=0.75)
builder.add_step("triplets", "triplet_extract", parallel_safe=True, include_temporal=True)
```

If any step in a layer is not marked `parallel_safe`, or if a step runs in delta mode, the entire layer falls back to sequential execution — parallelism never silently bypasses a step that was not declared safe. `parallel_safe` is a control field: like `dependencies`, it is consumed by the builder and never reaches your handler's config.

Parallel-safe handlers must return a dict. Each step in a parallel layer receives an isolated deep copy of the layer's input, so steps cannot see each other's mutations. The per-step results are merged key by key in step declaration order: a key written by one step is added to the merged output, a key written by several steps with equal values is kept, and two steps writing different values for the same key fail the pipeline with a `ProcessingError` naming the conflicting key and both steps. Handlers that touch shared mutable resources — database connections, in-memory stores, global caches — should not be marked `parallel_safe`.

## Common Pitfalls

**Forgetting to return data.** If a step handler doesn't return anything, downstream steps receive `None` as their `data` parameter. This usually causes crashes or silent failures. Every non-terminal step should return data for the next stage.

**Excessive parallelism.** Setting `max_workers=50` on an 8-core machine creates more overhead than speedup. Start with `max_workers=4` and increase gradually while monitoring resource usage. Most I/O-bound steps work well with moderate parallelism.

**Stateful handlers.** Step handlers should be pure functions — given the same input data and config, they should produce the same output. Avoid global variables, file handles, or database connections that persist between calls. Each step execution should be independent.

**Debugging large pipelines.** When a 10-step pipeline fails on step 7, don't re-run the entire pipeline to debug. Extract the failing step into a standalone script, use the actual intermediate data as input, and fix it in isolation.

## Development and Debugging

Start small and validate each step individually before building the full pipeline:

```python
# Add debug output in handlers during development
def extract_entities(data, **config):
    print(f"Processing {len(data)} items with threshold {config.get('confidence_threshold')}")
    results = []
    for item in data:
        # Your processing logic
        results.append({"text": item["text"], "entities": []})
    print(f"Generated {len(results)} results")
    return results

# Test individual handlers with known data
test_data = [{"text": "sample data", "entities": []}]
result = extract_entities(test_data, confidence_threshold=0.5)
print(f"Processed {len(result)} items")
```

For complex pipelines, add checkpoints to save intermediate outputs:

```python
def save_checkpoint(data, **config):
    # Save intermediate data for debugging
    checkpoint_path = config.get("checkpoint_path", "checkpoint.json")
    with open(checkpoint_path, "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f)
    return data  # Pass data through unchanged

builder.add_step(
    "checkpoint_after_transform", "checkpoint",
    handler=save_checkpoint,
    checkpoint_path="transform_output.json"
)
builder.connect_steps("transform", "checkpoint_after_transform")
```

## Delta / Incremental Processing

Delta pipelines process only changes between two versions of your data, rather than reprocessing everything from scratch. This is essential for large datasets where full reprocessing is too slow or expensive.

Your STIX bundle directory grows by 20–30 new files each night. Re-processing all 4,000 historical files every morning wastes time and compute. `delta_mode=True` on the ingest step tells the pipeline to process only files that have changed since the last version snapshot:

```python
builder = PipelineBuilder()
builder.register_step_handler("stix_ingest", ingest_stix_bundles)
builder.register_step_handler("ner_extract", run_ner)
builder.register_step_handler("kg_append",   append_to_graph)

builder.add_step(
    "ingest", "stix_ingest",
    handler           = ingest_stix_bundles,
    path              = "./stix_bundles/",
    delta_mode        = True,
    base_version_id   = "2024-11-30",   # last successful run
    target_version_id = "2024-12-01",   # today's snapshot
)
builder.add_step("extract", "ner_extract", handler=run_ner)
builder.add_step("store",   "kg_append",   handler=append_to_graph, output_path="./cti_output/")

builder.connect_steps("ingest",  "extract")
builder.connect_steps("extract", "store")

pipeline = builder.build("delta_pipeline")
result   = ExecutionEngine(max_workers=4, retry_on_failure=True).execute_pipeline(pipeline)

print(f"Delta run: {result.output}")
```

The `base_version_id` and `target_version_id` are stored on the `PipelineStep` dataclass and passed through to your handler via `config` — your handler is responsible for using them to filter its input. A typical pattern is to check file modification timestamps against the base version date.

## Building from a Config Dict

For pipelines defined in config files — useful when different environments (dev, staging, prod) run the same pipeline with different paths and thresholds — pass a dict to `build_pipeline()` instead of calling `add_step()` manually:

```python
from semantica.pipeline import PipelineBuilder, ExecutionEngine

pipeline_config = {
    "name": "cti_pipeline",
    "parallelism": 4,
    "steps": [
        {
            "name": "ingest",
            "type": "stix_ingest",
            "config": {"path": "./stix_bundles/"},
        },
        {
            "name": "extract",
            "type": "ner_extract",
            "config": {"confidence_threshold": 0.8},
        },
        {
            "name": "store",
            "type": "kg_build",
            "config": {"output_path": "./cti_output/"},
        },
    ],
}

builder = PipelineBuilder()
# Register handlers as before, then:
pipeline = builder.build_pipeline(pipeline_config)

engine = ExecutionEngine(max_workers=4, retry_on_failure=True)
result = engine.execute_pipeline(pipeline)
```

Note that `build_pipeline()` reads step connections from the `"dependencies"` key inside each step's config dict (not from `connect_steps()` calls). Add dependencies explicitly if you use this path:

```python
{
    "name": "extract",
    "type": "ner_extract",
    "config": {"confidence_threshold": 0.8, "dependencies": ["ingest"]},
},
```

## Monitoring Progress

`ExecutionEngine` integrates with Semantica's progress tracker automatically — every step start, update, and completion is recorded. To observe progress during a long-running pipeline, inspect step status on the `Pipeline` object after execution:

```python
from semantica.pipeline import StepStatus

result   = engine.execute_pipeline(pipeline)
for step in pipeline.steps:
    status_str = step.status.value   # "completed" / "failed" / "skipped"
    print(f"  {step.name:20s}  {status_str}")
    if step.status == StepStatus.FAILED and step.error:
        print(f"    Error: {step.error}")
```

`result.metrics` gives the aggregate view:

```python
print(f"Total time:      {result.metrics['execution_time']:.2f}s")
print(f"Steps completed: {result.metrics['steps_executed']}")
print(f"Steps failed:    {result.metrics['steps_failed']}")
```

    During an active P1 incident, the SOC needs a 15-minute pipeline that pulls fresh SIEM alert CSVs, cross-references CVEs from the internal database, and updates the incident knowledge graph.

    A compliance team runs a monthly incremental pipeline: ingest new BIS publications from the sitemap, extract capital-ratio and threshold entities, and append them to the existing compliance knowledge graph that already holds three years of regulatory history. Delta mode ensures only pages published since the last run are processed.
