## What Is Multi-Agent Coordination?

A multi-agent system is a software architecture where multiple autonomous agents work together to accomplish complex tasks that would be difficult or impossible for a single agent to handle effectively. Instead of building one monolithic agent that tries to do everything, developers split work across specialized agents that each focus on specific responsibilities.

**Why split work across multiple agents:**
- **Separation of concerns** — each agent specializes in one domain (ingestion, analysis, reporting) rather than trying to master everything
- **Independent reasoning** — different agents can use different models, prompts, and reasoning strategies optimized for their specific tasks  
- **Parallel processing** — multiple agents can work simultaneously on different aspects of the same problem
- **Human-like workflow decomposition** — mimics how human teams naturally divide complex analytical work

**Semantica's coordination approach:**
Semantica coordinates agents through shared context (memory and knowledge graphs) rather than message brokers or API calls between services. Agents read and write to the same underlying data structures, enabling seamless information sharing without complex middleware.

**Single-agent vs multi-agent architectures:**
- **Single-agent** — one `AgentContext` handles all tasks from ingestion through final output
- **Multi-agent** — multiple `AgentContext` instances or namespaced workflows, each responsible for specific pipeline stages or analytical roles

## Why Use Multi-Agent Systems?

**Separation of responsibilities.** Divide complex workflows into focused, manageable stages where each agent excels at its specific domain without being overwhelmed by tangential concerns.

**Scalability of complex workflows.** Handle sophisticated analytical pipelines that require different expertise areas, processing speeds, and reasoning approaches without creating unwieldy monolithic agents.

**Independent reasoning stages.** Enable different agents to use different LLMs, prompts, confidence thresholds, and reasoning strategies optimized for their specific tasks rather than compromising on a one-size-fits-all approach.

**Specialized agent roles.** Create agents tailored for ingestion, enrichment, analysis, synthesis, and reporting—each with role-appropriate configurations and capabilities.

**Shared knowledge and evidence.** Multiple agents contribute to and benefit from the same knowledge graph and memory stores, creating a cumulative evidence base that improves as more agents contribute their findings.

**Human-like workflow decomposition.** Mirror natural human team structures where analysts, researchers, and decision-makers each contribute specialized expertise to collaborative analytical processes.

## When To Use / When Not To Use

**Use multi-agent systems for:**
- Complex analytical workflows requiring multiple stages (research → analysis → synthesis → reporting)
- Multi-stage processing pipelines with distinct phases that benefit from specialized approaches
- Research and investigation workflows where different agents handle different information sources or analytical methods
- Teams of specialized agents with different roles (OSINT collector, enrichment analyst, fusion officer)
- Long-running workflows where different agents may operate at different times or schedules
- Scenarios requiring different LLMs, reasoning approaches, or confidence thresholds for different analytical stages

**Do NOT use multi-agent systems for:**
- Simple document summarization or single-step information retrieval tasks
- Linear workflows where one agent can handle all steps effectively without specialization benefits
- Small, straightforward tasks where the coordination overhead exceeds the complexity of the core work
- Cases where a single agent with appropriate configuration can handle the entire workflow efficiently

**Important consideration:** Multi-agent systems introduce additional architectural complexity including state management, coordination patterns, and debugging challenges. Only choose multi-agent approaches when the benefits of specialization and separation of concerns outweigh this added complexity.

Semantica coordinates multiple agents through a shared `ContextGraph` — agents read and write to the same graph, or hand off serialized state via `save()` and `load()`, with no message broker required. Use this pattern when splitting work across ingestion, enrichment, reasoning, and reporting roles that must share a single evidence base.

## The Three Coordination Patterns

Before writing any code, choose the right coordination pattern for your pipeline.

**Shared Graph Pattern:** Multiple agents share references to the same `ContextGraph` and `VectorStore` objects within a single process. This provides the lowest latency since all agents see changes immediately, with built-in thread safety for concurrent access. Choose this when agents run simultaneously in the same application and need real-time access to each other's contributions.

**Save / Load Handoff Pattern:** Agents run in different processes, containers, or at different times. The first agent completes its work and calls `context.save(path)` to serialize its complete state. The next agent calls `context.load(path)` to restore exactly where the previous agent left off, including full memory, graph data, and vector indices. Choose this for distributed systems, scheduled workflows, or when agents run on different machines that require shared storage access.

**Namespaced Memory Pattern:** A single `AgentContext` serves multiple logical agents, with each agent scoping its reads and writes using unique `conversation_id` values. Agents remain isolated by namespace rather than by separate context instances. Choose this for lightweight role separation without the resource overhead of maintaining multiple complete contexts.

The pipeline in this guide uses all three.

## Pattern 1 — Shared Graph for Concurrent Ingestion

The OSINT (**Open Source Intelligence** — publicly available information) collector and the enrichment agent run concurrently. They share a single `ContextGraph` and a single `VectorStore` — the graph's internal `RLock` makes concurrent writes safe.

```python
import threading
from semantica.context import AgentContext, ContextGraph
from semantica.vector_store import VectorStore

# One graph, one vector store — both agents write to these
shared_graph = ContextGraph(advanced_analytics=True)
shared_vs    = VectorStore(backend="faiss", dimension=768)

def make_agent() -> AgentContext:
    """Factory: each agent gets its own AgentContext wrapping the shared backing stores."""
    return AgentContext(
        vector_store=shared_vs,            # same VectorStore instance
        knowledge_graph=shared_graph,      # same ContextGraph instance
        graph_expansion=True,
        max_expansion_hops=2,
        decision_tracking=True,
    )

osint_agent      = make_agent()
enrichment_agent = make_agent()
reasoning_agent  = make_agent()
```

The OSINT collector's job is to ingest raw feeds and extract entities. It does not reason — it just ingests and lets the graph accumulate structure.

```python
def osint_collection():
    """Agent 1: ingest raw threat feeds and CVE data."""
    osint_agent.store(
        [
            {
                "content": "APT29 exploits CVE-2024-3400 in PAN-OS GlobalProtect — unauthenticated RCE, CVSS 10.0",
                "metadata": {"source": "nvd_feed", "cve": "CVE-2024-3400", "actor": "APT29"},
            },
            {
                "content": "Volexity confirms active exploitation of CVE-2024-3400 against NATO member networks",
                "metadata": {"source": "volexity_blog", "actor": "APT29", "target": "NATO"},
            },
            {
                "content": "PAN-OS GlobalProtect affected versions: < 10.2.9-h1, < 11.0.4-h1, < 11.1.2-h3",
                "metadata": {"source": "paloalto_advisory", "cve": "CVE-2024-3400", "product": "GlobalProtect"},
            },
        ],
        extract_entities=True,
        extract_relationships=True,
        conversation_id="osint-pipeline",    # namespace acts as agent identifier
    )
```

While the OSINT collector is running, the enrichment agent is independently pulling actor-profile data and linking it into the same graph.

```python
def enrichment():
    """Agent 2: enrich the graph with actor profile and TTP context."""
    enrichment_agent.store(
        [
            {
                "content": "APT29 TTP profile: T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application), T1071.001 (Web Protocols C2), T1078 (Valid Accounts)",
                "metadata": {"source": "mitre_attck", "actor": "APT29", "type": "ttp_profile"},
            },
            {
                "content": "APT29 infrastructure fingerprint: use of Cloudflare Workers for C2 relay, certificate reuse across campaigns",
                "metadata": {"source": "recorded_future", "actor": "APT29", "type": "infrastructure"},
            },
        ],
        extract_entities=True,
        extract_relationships=True,
        conversation_id="enrichment-pipeline",    # separate namespace from OSINT agent
    )
```

Run both concurrently — the graph handles the locking.

```python
t1 = threading.Thread(target=osint_collection)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=enrichment)
t1.start(); t2.start()
t1.join();  t2.join()

# The shared graph now contains entities and relationships from both agents.
# The reasoning agent can query across everything both agents stored.
```

## Pattern 2 — Save / Load Handoff to a Reasoning Agent

The reasoning agent runs after ingestion completes. In a production pipeline this might be a separate process, a different container, or a scheduled job. The ingestion agents save their shared state; the reasoning agent loads it.

**Important deployment note:** When agents run in different containers or on different machines, they must have access to the same saved state location through shared storage (network file systems, cloud storage, or shared volumes).

```python
# After ingestion: save the combined graph and vector index
osint_agent.save("./pipeline/enriched_intel/")
# Writes:
#   pipeline/enriched_intel/agent_memory.json     — all MemoryItems
#   pipeline/enriched_intel/vector_store/         — FAISS index
#   pipeline/enriched_intel/knowledge_graph.json  — all nodes and edges

print("Ingestion complete. State saved for reasoning agent.")
```

The reasoning agent starts fresh, loads the state, and has full access to everything the ingestion agents built.

```python
from semantica.context import AgentContext, ContextGraph
from semantica.vector_store import VectorStore
from semantica.llms import LiteLLM

# Create a context to load the checkpoint into — load() will overwrite existing state
reasoning_vs    = VectorStore(backend="faiss", dimension=768)
reasoning_graph = ContextGraph(advanced_analytics=True)
reasoning_agent = AgentContext(
    vector_store=reasoning_vs,
    knowledge_graph=reasoning_graph,
    graph_expansion=True,
    max_expansion_hops=3,
    decision_tracking=True,
)

reasoning_agent.load("./pipeline/enriched_intel/")
# All memories, graph nodes, and vector embeddings from both ingestion agents are now available.

# Use a high-capability model for the synthesis step
llm = LiteLLM(model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-5")

synthesis = reasoning_agent.query_with_reasoning(
    "Summarize the APT29 exploitation of CVE-2024-3400: affected products, "
    "observed TTPs, targeted sectors, and recommended mitigations.",
    llm_provider=llm,
    max_results=15,
    max_hops=3,
)

print(synthesis["response"])
print("Confidence: {:.0%}".format(synthesis["confidence"]))

# Store the synthesis back into the graph — the reporting agent will retrieve it
reasoning_agent.store(
    "SYNTHESIS: " + synthesis["response"],
    metadata={"type": "synthesis", "agent": "reasoning", "confidence": synthesis["confidence"]},
    conversation_id="synthesis-output",
)

# Record the analytical judgment as a traceable decision
reasoning_agent.record_decision(
    category="threat_assessment",
    scenario="APT29 active exploitation of CVE-2024-3400 in PAN-OS",
    reasoning=synthesis["reasoning_path"],
    outcome="high_priority_patch_advisory",
    confidence=synthesis["confidence"],
    entities=["APT29", "CVE-2024-3400", "GlobalProtect", "NATO"],
    decision_maker="reasoning_agent_v2",
)

# Hand off to the reporting agent
reasoning_agent.save("./pipeline/synthesis_output/")
```

<Info>
  `load()` overwrites the existing context — it clears current memory, graph, and vector state before loading. Any unsaved data in the context prior to calling `load()` will be lost.
</Info>

## Pattern 3 — Namespaced Memories for Role Separation

The reporting agent does not need its own graph instance. It shares the reasoning agent's context but scopes its writes to its own namespace — the `conversation_id` acts as an agent identifier to separate memory streams and prevent contamination between different logical agents.

**Namespace isolation with conversation_id:**
- `conversation_id` creates separate memory namespaces within the same `AgentContext`
- Each agent's memories remain isolated unless explicitly queried across namespaces
- Prevents accidental memory contamination when different logical agents work on related but distinct tasks

```python
# The reporting agent loads the synthesis output
reporting_vs    = VectorStore(backend="faiss", dimension=768)
reporting_graph = ContextGraph()
reporting_agent = AgentContext(
    vector_store=reporting_vs,
    knowledge_graph=reporting_graph,
    graph_expansion=True,
)
reporting_agent.load("./pipeline/synthesis_output/")

# Retrieve everything the reasoning agent produced
synthesis_items = reporting_agent.retrieve(
    "APT29 CVE-2024-3400 threat assessment synthesis",
    max_results=10,
    conversation_id="synthesis-output",   # scoped to reasoning agent's output
)

# Build the finished brief
brief_sections = []
for item in synthesis_items:
    brief_sections.append(item["content"])

# Store the final report under the reporting agent's own namespace
reporting_agent.store(
    "\n\n".join(brief_sections),
    metadata={"type": "finished_report", "classification": "TLP:GREEN"},  # TLP (Traffic Light Protocol) — information sharing guidelines
    conversation_id="reporting-output",    # reporting agent's namespace
    user_id="reporting_agent",
)

# The full pipeline audit trail: retrieve across all namespaces
full_trail = reporting_agent.retrieve("APT29 CVE-2024-3400", max_results=25)
print("Pipeline produced {} traceable context items".format(len(full_trail)))
```

Each agent's contributions are retrievable individually by filtering on `conversation_id`, or collectively by querying without a filter.

## Common Pitfalls

**Forgetting conversation_id namespaces.** Without unique `conversation_id` values, different agents' memories mix together, making it impossible to trace which agent contributed which insights. Always use distinct, meaningful conversation IDs for each logical agent.

**Accidental state loss with load().** The `load()` function overwrites existing context rather than merging it. If you have unsaved state in an `AgentContext`, calling `load()` will wipe it. Always save your current state or use a fresh context before loading a checkpoint.

**Using Shared Graph across separate processes.** The Shared Graph pattern only works within a single process where agents share object references. For distributed agents running in different containers or machines, use the Save/Load Handoff pattern instead.

**Assuming save/load works without shared storage.** Agents in different processes, containers, or machines must have access to the same filesystem location for save/load handoffs. Ensure shared storage (NFS, cloud storage, shared volumes) is properly configured.

**Overengineering simple workflows with multiple agents.** Multi-agent systems add coordination complexity and potential failure points. For straightforward single-step tasks, a simple single-agent approach is often more reliable and easier to debug.

**Mixing agent responsibilities excessively.** Each agent should have a clear, focused role. Agents that try to do too many different tasks lose the benefits of specialization and become harder to optimize, debug, and maintain.

**Ignoring memory isolation boundaries.** When using namespaced memories, be careful about queries that span multiple `conversation_id` values. Unscoped queries can accidentally retrieve memories from other agents, breaking logical isolation.

A three-agent intelligence fusion cell: an OSINT collector ingests public feeds, a HUMINT (**Human Intelligence** — information gathered from human sources) analyst loads classified summaries, and a fusion officer synthesizes both streams into a PIR (**Priority Intelligence Requirement** — critical information needed for decision-making) answer.

A four-agent credit committee: a risk desk agent computes PD/LGD, a compliance desk agent checks Basel III and EBA requirements, a credit officer agent applies policy, and a committee chair agent reads across all three desks to produce the final decision with a complete audit trail. Each desk namespaces its findings; the chair reads across all namespaces.

## Memory Isolation Reference

When multiple agents write to a shared context, use `conversation_id` to isolate their streams and retrieve them individually.

```python
# Tag a memory to an agent's namespace
context.store("Finding: lateral movement confirmed", conversation_id="tier2-ir")

# Retrieve only that agent's memories
tier2_history = context.retrieve("lateral movement", conversation_id="tier2-ir")

# Get the full ordered history for a namespace
full_history = context.conversation("tier2-ir", max_items=100)

# Delete an agent's entire namespace
context.forget(conversation_id="tier2-ir")
```

The same pattern works for user-scoped isolation — replace `conversation_id` with `user_id`:

```python
context.store("...", user_id="analyst-jsmith")
context.retrieve("...", user_id="analyst-jsmith")
```
