title: "GraphRAG: Graph-Augmented Retrieval"
description: "Go beyond vector search: retrieve facts, trace reasoning paths, and ground LLM responses in your knowledge graph."
---

GraphRAG combines vector similarity with knowledge graph traversal so retrieval finds structurally connected facts, not just text that sounds related. When a `ContextGraph` is attached to `AgentContext`, every retrieval call automatically blends semantic search with multi-hop graph expansion, and `query_with_reasoning()` returns an auditable reasoning path alongside the LLM answer.

## What Is GraphRAG?

GraphRAG (Graph-Augmented Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enhances traditional RAG by combining vector similarity search with knowledge graph traversal. Instead of retrieving only semantically similar text, GraphRAG follows relationships between entities to find connected evidence across multiple documents.

**GraphRAG vs. traditional vector-only RAG:** Vector RAG finds documents similar to your query text. GraphRAG finds documents similar to your query AND documents connected to those through entity relationships, even if they don't mention your query terms directly.

**The role of graph traversal:** Starting from entities found in vector-similar documents, GraphRAG expands outward through relationship edges to discover related facts. This reveals connections that pure text similarity would miss, like finding that a threat actor targets healthcare by following the path: Actor → Tool → Victim Organization → Industry Sector.

## Why Use GraphRAG?

**Multi-hop discovery.** Find facts that are 2-3 relationship steps away from your query. A question about "APT29 healthcare targeting" can surface evidence about specific hospitals by traversing: APT29 → HAMMERTOSS → LifeCare → Healthcare Sector.

**Connected evidence.** Instead of isolated document fragments, retrieve coherent chains of related entities and their relationships. This provides richer context for LLM responses and human analysis.

**Investigation workflows.** Follow evidence trails by expanding from known entities through their connections. Start with a suspicious IP and discover the full infrastructure chain, or trace a drug interaction through metabolic pathways.

**Richer retrieval context.** Graph expansion surfaces relevant context that keyword or semantic search alone would miss, leading to more complete and accurate LLM responses.

**Explainability.** GraphRAG provides audit trails showing exactly which entities and relationships led to each piece of retrieved evidence, making the retrieval process transparent and verifiable.

## When To Use / When Not To Use

**GraphRAG adds value when:**
- Your domain has rich entity relationships (threat intelligence, clinical data, regulatory documents)
- Questions require connecting facts across multiple documents
- Investigation workflows benefit from following entity connections
- Explainability and audit trails are important
- You have well-structured knowledge graphs with meaningful relationships

**Simple vector search may be sufficient for:**
- Document retrieval based on topic similarity
- Single-document question answering
- Exploratory search where you don't know what you're looking for
- Domains with few meaningful entity relationships

**Latency and complexity considerations:**
- GraphRAG adds computational overhead from graph traversal
- Multi-hop expansion increases retrieval time and token usage
- Graph quality directly impacts retrieval quality
- Setup requires entity extraction and relationship building

**GraphRAG may be overkill for:**
- Simple lookup queries with known answers in specific documents
- Real-time applications where latency is critical
- Domains where entity relationships don't provide additional value

## Typical GraphRAG Workflow

**Ingest → Build Graph → Retrieve → Expand Context → Reason → Answer**

1. **Ingest** your documents using `AgentContext.store()` with entity extraction enabled
2. **Build Graph** through Named Entity Recognition (NER) and relationship extraction to populate the `ContextGraph`
3. **Retrieve** semantically similar documents and identify seed entities for graph expansion
4. **Expand Context** by following entity relationships within your specified hop limit
5. **Reason** (optional) using the expanded context with reasoning engines
6. **Answer** by providing the enriched context to an LLM through `query_with_reasoning()`

<Info>
  **Graph Quality Dependency:** GraphRAG retrieval quality depends heavily on graph quality, consistent entity linking, and meaningful relationships. Poor entity extraction, duplicate entities, or weak relationships directly impact retrieval effectiveness.
</Info>

<Info>
  **Context Expansion Warning:** Larger hop counts exponentially increase the amount of retrieved context, which can significantly increase LLM token usage and processing time. Start with 2-3 hops and monitor context size for your use case.
</Info>

<Info>
GraphRAG activates automatically when you pass `knowledge_graph=` to `AgentContext`. There is no separate mode to switch on. The `hybrid_alpha` parameter and `proximity_weight` argument control how much influence graph structure has relative to vector similarity.
</Info>

## Building the graph and loading your intelligence

Before you can query the graph, you need to build it. The setup is three objects: a vector store for embedding-based retrieval, a `ContextGraph` for structural traversal, and an `AgentContext` that wires them together.

```python
from semantica.context import AgentContext, ContextGraph
from semantica.vector_store import VectorStore

# FAISS runs locally with no external dependencies
vs = VectorStore(backend="faiss", dimension=768)
graph = ContextGraph(advanced_analytics=True)

context = AgentContext(
    vector_store=vs,
    knowledge_graph=graph,
    graph_expansion=True,     # enable multi-hop traversal from seed nodes
    max_expansion_hops=3,     # APT29 → infrastructure → victim → sector is 3 hops
    hybrid_alpha=0.6,         # 60% graph influence, 40% vector similarity
    decision_tracking=True,   # record analyst queries as auditable decisions
)
```

Now ingest your documents. `store()` with `extract_entities=True` runs the full extraction pipeline internally (Named Entity Recognition, relation extraction, and entity linking) and populates both the vector index and the graph simultaneously:

```python
intel_documents = [
    {
        "content": "APT29 deployed HAMMERTOSS malware against NATO logistics networks in Jan–Mar 2025. "
                   "C2 infrastructure used Tor exit nodes in AS59796.",
        "metadata": {"source": "FINTEL_2025_0192", "classification": "SECRET//NOFORN"},
    },
    {
        "content": "HAMMERTOSS was subsequently observed on hosts in the LifeCare hospital network "
                   "(AS64496), suggesting lateral movement beyond the initial NATO targets.",
        "metadata": {"source": "FINTEL_2025_0211"},
    },
    {
        "content": "LifeCare operates 47 acute-care hospitals and is classified as Tier-1 "
                   "healthcare critical infrastructure under CISA Sector 6.",
        "metadata": {"source": "CISA_CI_REGISTRY_2025"},
    },
    {
        "content": "Healthcare critical infrastructure has been a high-priority targeting class "
                   "for Russian state-sponsored threat actors since 2022.",
        "metadata": {"source": "NCSC_ADVISORY_2024_12"},
    },
]

stats = context.store(
    intel_documents,
    extract_entities=True,
    extract_relationships=True,
    link_entities=True,    # merge duplicate entity mentions across documents
)

print("Graph built: {} nodes, {} edges".format(
    stats["graph_nodes"], stats["graph_edges"]
))
```

`store()` returns a dict with `stored_count`, `memory_ids`, `graph_nodes`, and
`graph_edges`. The extracted nodes (APT29, HAMMERTOSS, LifeCare, AS59796, …) and
edges (`deployed`, `observed_on`, `classified_as`, …) now span all four documents.

The graph now contains a connected subgraph linking APT29 to healthcare infrastructure across four document boundaries, something that would be invisible to a pure vector search.

## Retrieving the relevant subgraph

With the graph populated, a plain `retrieve()` call already does more than vector search. When `use_graph=True`, the retriever seeds the graph traversal from the top-k vector matches and expands outward by following edges. Expansion depth is set once, by `max_expansion_hops` on the `AgentContext` constructor:

```python
results = context.retrieve(
    "APT29 tactics against healthcare",
    use_graph=True,
    max_results=10,
    expand_graph=True,
)

for r in results:
    print("[score={:.3f}]  {}".format(
        r["score"],
        r["content"][:90],
    ))

# [score=0.921]  APT29 deployed HAMMERTOSS malware against NATO...
# [score=0.887]  HAMMERTOSS was subsequently observed on hosts in the LifeCare...
# [score=0.841]  LifeCare operates 47 acute-care hospitals...
# [score=0.798]  Healthcare critical infrastructure has been a high-priority...
```

Notice the top results: while pure vector search might rank connected facts lower because they lack keyword overlap, GraphRAG boosts their final `score` because they are structurally adjacent to the seed nodes in the graph. The returned `score` is a transparent blend of vector relevance and graph connectivity.

When you know specifically which entity you want to anchor the traversal to, pass `anchor_node`:

```python
# Anchor on APT29 explicitly: proximity scores are calculated from this node
apt29_intel = context.retrieve(
    "C2 infrastructure beaconing patterns",
    use_graph=True,
    anchor_node="APT29",
    proximity_weight=0.7,   # strongly favour nodes close to APT29
    max_hops=3,             # with an anchor, this bounds the proximity radius
    max_results=8,
)
```

<Note>
  `max_hops` on `retrieve()` only takes effect when `anchor_node` is set: it
  bounds the proximity radius used for scoring and drops results farther than
  `max_hops` from the anchor. Without an `anchor_node` it is ignored. It does
  **not** change how far graph expansion reaches: that is fixed by
  `max_expansion_hops` on the constructor.
</Note>

## Getting a grounded LLM answer with a reasoning path

`retrieve()` gives you the grounded context. `query_with_reasoning()` goes one step further: it passes that subgraph context to an LLM and returns the answer together with the multi-hop path the retrieval system traced through the graph. That path is your audit trail.

```python
from semantica.llms import LiteLLM

llm = LiteLLM(model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-5")

result = context.query_with_reasoning(
    "What are APT29's known TTPs against healthcare infrastructure, "
    "and what is the evidence chain connecting them?",
    llm_provider=llm,
    max_results=12,
    max_hops=3,
)

# The LLM answer, grounded in graph-retrieved context, not training memory
print(result["response"])

# The multi-hop trace: APT29 → deployed → HAMMERTOSS → observed_on → LifeCare → ...
print("\n--- Reasoning Path ---")
print(result["reasoning_path"])

# Confidence reflects how well the retrieved context supports the answer
print("\nConfidence: {:.1%}".format(result["confidence"]))

# Inspect every source the LLM was given
print("\nSources ({} total):".format(result["num_sources"]))
for src in result["sources"]:
    print("  [{:.3f}] {}".format(src["score"], src["content"][:80]))
```

The `reasoning_path` field is what separates GraphRAG from a black-box LLM call. When an analyst asks "how do you know APT29 targeted healthcare?", you can show them the exact traversal the system made across your own documents, not a claim the model generated from training data.

The full return structure from `query_with_reasoning()`:

```python
{
    "response":             str,   # LLM-generated answer, grounded in retrieved subgraph
    "reasoning_path":       str,   # multi-hop traversal narrative
    "sources":              list,  # list of retrieved context dicts with scores
    "confidence":           float, # 0–1 aggregate confidence
    "num_sources":          int,
    "num_reasoning_paths":  int,
}
```

Regulatory compliance: Basel III (CRE20), BCBS 239, SR 11-7, and EBA IRRBB guidelines ingested as a graph where regulation articles cross-reference each other as edges.

## Common Pitfalls

**Excessive hop counts.** Setting `max_expansion_hops` too high (>4) creates exponentially large context that overwhelms LLMs and increases costs. Start with 2-3 hops and increase only if needed.

**Poor graph quality.** GraphRAG amplifies graph quality issues. Duplicate entities, inconsistent naming, and weak relationships produce poor retrieval results. Clean your graph data before relying on GraphRAG for important queries.

**Duplicate entities.** Having "APT-29", "APT29", and "Cozy Bear" as separate nodes breaks relationship traversal. Entity linking during ingestion helps, but manual deduplication may be necessary.

**Using GraphRAG for simple lookup queries.** If you know the answer exists in a specific document and just need to retrieve it, traditional vector search is faster and simpler than GraphRAG.

**Assuming graph expansion is always beneficial.** More context isn't always better. Sometimes precise, focused retrieval outperforms broad graph expansion. Test both approaches for your specific use cases.

## Tuning the vector-graph balance

The `hybrid_alpha` parameter set in the `AgentContext` constructor establishes a default blend between vector similarity and graph influence. `0.0` is pure vector retrieval; `1.0` is pure graph traversal. The recommended starting point is `0.5`.

When targeting a specific `anchor_node`, you can apply `proximity_weight` in `retrieve()` to dynamically blend structural distance from the anchor into the final score:

```python
# Anchor node provided: let vector semantics lead, graph proximity only slightly boosts
results = context.retrieve(
    query, use_graph=True, anchor_node="APT29", proximity_weight=0.2
)

# Known-entity tracing: topology drives the retrieval
results = context.retrieve(
    query, use_graph=True, anchor_node="APT29", proximity_weight=0.8
)
```

Each additional expansion hop exponentially increases the subgraph size. Practical defaults by domain:

```text
General Q&A             max_expansion_hops=2  (95% of useful facts within 2 hops)
Threat intel (APT)      max_expansion_hops=3  (actor → infra → victim → attribution)
Drug interactions       max_expansion_hops=3  (drug → enzyme → metabolite → interaction)
Regulatory cross-ref    max_expansion_hops=2  (rule → article → article)
```

Expansion depth is a constructor setting only (`max_expansion_hops`); there is no per-call override on `retrieve()`. `query_with_reasoning()` does take a per-call `max_hops` argument.

```

The vector search and graph traversal run independently, then their scores are fused. The graph traversal uses breadth-first expansion from the seed nodes identified by the vector search, so the graph component is always anchored in semantic relevance rather than exploring the entire graph blindly.
