## What Is MCP?

MCP stands for the Model Context Protocol. It is an open standard that allows external AI assistants (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Windsurf) to securely access local tools and data sources. 

The Semantica MCP server exposes your knowledge graph as 15 callable tools. By connecting it, any compatible AI client can traverse the graph live, record decisions, run analytics, and export results during a conversation — without you having to write custom tool wrappers.

<Info>
  The Semantica MCP server exposes 15 tools and 3 read-only resources. All tools accept and return JSON. No configuration beyond an optional environment variable for graph persistence is required.
</Info>

## Architecture & Communication

It is important to understand how MCP works under the hood. **The Semantica MCP server is not a REST API.** There are no network ports, no HTTP endpoints, and no API keys required.

Instead, the AI client launches `semantica-mcp` locally as a subprocess. All communication between the AI and Semantica happens securely through standard input and output (`stdio`). Because the server runs locally under your user account, it inherently has your local file permissions.

## Why Use MCP With Semantica?

- **Zero-Code Integration**: Instantly connect Semantica's graph capabilities to your favorite AI IDE or desktop chat app without writing any glue code.
- **Real-Time Graph Updates**: Chat with an AI to extract entities from documents and watch them populate your live knowledge graph instantly.
- **Auditable AI**: Use the AI to make decisions and have it automatically record the reasoning and causal chain directly into the graph via Semantica's decision intelligence tools.

## When To Use / When Not To Use

- **When to Use**: You want to use a third-party AI interface (like Claude Desktop or Windsurf) to manipulate, query, and reason over a Semantica knowledge graph on your local machine.
- **When NOT to Use**: You are building an autonomous Python script or backend service. If you are writing Python code to build an agent, use `semantica.context.AgentContext` natively instead of spinning up an MCP server. The MCP server does not support remote hosting over HTTP/SSE.

## Typical Workflow

Connecting your AI client follows a standard progression:

1. **Install**: Install Semantica in your Python environment.
2. **Configure Client**: Add the `semantica-mcp` command and absolute graph paths to your AI client's JSON configuration.
3. **Start Client**: Launch Claude Desktop or Windsurf, which automatically spawns the MCP server.
4. **Tool Calls**: Prompt the AI in natural language. The AI autonomously chains the 15 available tools.
5. **Graph Updates**: The AI directly modifies your local graph, adding entities, edges, and decisions.

---

## Starting the Server

Install Semantica, then configure your client to launch the MCP server. The server runs using the `stdio` transport.

```bash
pip install semantica
```

```bash
# Via the CLI entry-point (recommended)
semantica-mcp

# Or via the Python module directly
python -m semantica.mcp_server
```

By default, the server logs at `WARNING` level and produces no startup output. Set `SEMANTICA_LOG_LEVEL=INFO` (or `DEBUG`) to see startup messages on stderr. Without `SEMANTICA_KG_PATH` the server initialises an empty in-memory graph — sufficient for testing. For a persistent graph that survives restarts, set the path:

```bash
SEMANTICA_KG_PATH=/data/threat_graph.json semantica-mcp
```

<Info>
  Without `SEMANTICA_KG_PATH`, the graph resets when the server process exits. Always set this path using an absolute file path for any session whose data should survive a restart.
</Info>

## Connecting to Claude Desktop

Edit the Claude Desktop config file — on macOS at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`, on Windows at `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "semantica": {
      "command": "semantica-mcp",
      "env": {
        "SEMANTICA_KG_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/knowledge_graph.json",
        "SEMANTICA_LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving. The Semantica tools appear in the tool palette automatically — Claude can now call them during any conversation.

If `semantica-mcp` is not on your system PATH (for example, if it is installed in a virtualenv), use the full absolute binary path in `"command"`: `"/path/to/venv/bin/semantica-mcp"`.

## Connecting to Other Clients

**Windsurf** — in Settings → MCP Servers → Add Server, or edit `~/.windsurf/mcp_servers.json`:

```json
{
  "semantica": {
    "command": "semantica-mcp",
    "env": { "SEMANTICA_KG_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/knowledge_graph.json" }
  }
}
```

**VS Code (Cline / Roo Code / Continue)** — add to `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "semantica": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "semantica-mcp",
      "env": {
        "SEMANTICA_KG_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/knowledge_graph.json",
        "SEMANTICA_LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Docker**:

```bash
docker run --rm -i \
  -e SEMANTICA_KG_PATH=/data/kg.json \
  -v /local/absolute/path:/data \
  ghcr.io/semantica-agi/semantica-mcp:latest
```

## What the Agent Can Do: The 15 Tools

Once connected, the LLM can call any of these tools during a conversation. The agent chains them automatically — you do not orchestrate the sequence, you just describe what you want.

**Entity and relation extraction** — `extract_entities` pulls named entities from free text; `extract_relations` extracts semantic relationships and RDF triplets. These two tools turn a raw OSINT report into structured graph inputs without any preprocessing.

**Knowledge graph manipulation** — `add_entity` adds a node, `add_relationship` adds a directed edge. After extraction, the agent calls these to persist what it found into the live graph.

**Live graph queries and edits** — `query_graph` reads the graph without exporting it: fetch one node, walk its neighbours up to five hops, or keyword-search nodes. `update_node` merges properties onto an existing node (for example marking a task node `done`), and `delete_node` archives a node it no longer tracks. When `SEMANTICA_KG_PATH` is set, `update_node` and `delete_node` write their changes back to that file so they survive a restart.

**Decision intelligence** — `record_decision` writes a decision as a provenance node with confidence score, reasoning, and decision maker identity. `query_decisions` retrieves past decisions by query or category. `find_precedents` finds the most similar past decisions by semantic similarity. `get_causal_chain` traces decision causality upstream or downstream.

**Reasoning** — `run_reasoning` applies forward-chaining IF/THEN rules over a set of facts and returns derived conclusions.

**Analytics and export** — `get_graph_analytics` computes PageRank centrality and community detection. `get_graph_summary` returns node count, decision count, and server status. `export_graph` serializes the current graph to Turtle (`"turtle"` / `"ttl"`), RDF/XML (`"xml"`), N-Triples (`"nt"`), JSON-LD (`"json-ld"`), or plain JSON (`"json"`).

## Universal Example: Employee Directory

Before diving into complex domain examples, here is a simple, universally understood session. An HR manager types a prompt into Claude Desktop:

> "Extract entities from this meeting transcript about Alice transferring to Engineering, add them to the graph, and record a promotion decision."

Claude chains four tool calls automatically:

```text
1. extract_entities(text="Alice is transferring to Engineering...")
   → { "entities": [{"label": "Alice", "type": "Employee"}, {"label": "Engineering", "type": "Department"}] }

2. add_entity(id="emp-alice", label="Alice", type="Employee")
   add_entity(id="dept-eng", label="Engineering", type="Department")

3. add_relationship(source="emp-alice", target="dept-eng", type="WORKS_IN")

4. record_decision(
       category="promotion",
       scenario="Alice transferring to Engineering",
       reasoning="Approved by Engineering Director",
       outcome="transfer_approved",
       confidence=1.0
   )
```
The graph is updated instantly with the new organizational structure and a fully auditable decision trail.

## Watching a Real Agent Session

Here is what happens when a cybersecurity analyst types a prompt into Claude Desktop and the graph is live. The prompt is:

> "Extract entities and relationships from this OSINT report, add them to the knowledge graph, then record an attribution decision for APT29 with confidence 0.88 and export the full graph as Turtle."

Claude chains six tool calls automatically:

```text
1. extract_entities(text="<report text>")
   → { "entities": [{"label": "APT29", "type": "ThreatActor"}, ...] }

2. extract_relations(text="<report text>")
   → { "relations": [{"source": "APT29", "type": "EXPLOITS", "target": "CVE-2024-3400"}] }

3. add_entity(id="apt29", label="APT29", type="ThreatActor", metadata={"alias": "NOBELIUM"})
   → { "status": "added", "id": "apt29" }
   (repeated for each extracted entity)

4. add_relationship(source="apt29", target="cve-2024-3400", type="EXPLOITS",
                    metadata={"confidence": 0.97})
   → { "status": "added" }
   (repeated for each extracted relation)

5. record_decision(
       category="threat_attribution",
       scenario="C2 beacon from 185.220.101.47, TTP T1566.001 observed",
       reasoning="IP overlaps APT29 infrastructure cluster; TTPs match NOBELIUM phishing playbook",
       outcome="attributed_to_apt29",
       confidence=0.88,
       decision_maker="analyst_zhang"
   )
   → { "decision_id": "dec_a3f2b1", "status": "recorded" }

6. export_graph(format="turtle")
   → { "format": "turtle", "data": "@prefix ... <apt29> a :ThreatActor ..." }
```

The analyst asked one question in natural language. Six structured tool calls happened against live graph data. The result is a populated graph, a recorded attribution decision with full provenance, and a Turtle export ready for the SPARQL endpoint — all in a single conversation turn.

## The Three Read-Only Resources

Resources expose graph state without a tool call — the client can read them at any point:

| URI | Description |
| :-- | :---------- |
| `semantica://graph/summary` | Node count, decision count, server status |
| `semantica://decisions/list` | Up to 50 most recent recorded decisions |
| `semantica://schema/info` | Server version, capabilities, available tool list |

## Domain Examples

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Defense — CTI/Threat">

The CTI team uses Claude Desktop to correlate new OSINT reports against the existing threat graph, record attribution decisions, and query causal chains — all through natural language, with the graph updated live.

**Analyst prompt:**
> "Extract entities from this Mandiant report on APT40, add them to the knowledge graph, find any past decisions about APT40 attribution, and record a new attribution decision with confidence 0.84."

Claude chains automatically:

1. `extract_entities` + `extract_relations` on the report text
2. `add_entity` for each extracted entity (APT40, CVEs, infrastructure nodes)
3. `add_relationship` for each extracted relation
4. `query_decisions(query="APT40 attribution", category="threat_attribution")`
5. `find_precedents(scenario="APT40 targeting maritime sector", max_results=3)`
6. `record_decision(category="threat_attribution", outcome="attributed_to_apt40", confidence=0.84, decision_maker="analyst_zhang")`

The attribution is now a graph node linked to the OSINT evidence, searchable by future agents.

```json
{
  "category": "threat_attribution",
  "scenario": "C2 infrastructure overlaps APT40 cluster; TEMP.Periscope TTPs confirmed",
  "reasoning": "Three C2 IPs match known APT40 hosting ASN; T1190 exploit chain identical to 2023 campaign",
  "outcome": "attributed_to_apt40",
  "confidence": 0.84,
  "decision_maker": "analyst_zhang"
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Security — SOC/Incident">

During a live incident, the SOC uses Claude to reason over the graph, apply zero-trust policy rules, and record containment decisions with their causal chain — creating a real-time audit trail.

**SOC analyst prompt:**
> "Add WKSTN-047 and DC01 as hosts, add the lateral movement relationship between them, run reasoning to classify the severity, and record a containment decision."

Claude chains:

1. `add_entity(id="wkstn-047", type="Host", label="WKSTN-047")`
2. `add_entity(id="dc01", type="Host", label="DC01")`
3. `add_relationship(source="wkstn-047", target="dc01", type="lateral_movement")`
4. `run_reasoning(facts=["Host(WKSTN-047)", "LateralMove(WKSTN-047, DC01)", "DC(DC01)"], rules=["IF LateralMove(X, Y) AND DC(Y) THEN CriticalIncident(X)"])`
5. `record_decision(category="containment", scenario="Lateral movement to DC detected", outcome="isolate_wkstn047", confidence=0.95)`
6. `get_causal_chain(decision_id="...", direction="downstream", max_depth=3)`

The containment decision and its downstream effects are captured in the graph for the post-mortem.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Life Science — Clinical/Pharma">

Clinical AI assistants use the MCP server to record treatment decisions with provenance, retrieve guideline precedents, and export decision graphs for regulatory submission and MDT review.

**Clinical prompt:**
> "The patient has eGFR 28 and is on metformin. Find precedents for metformin dose modification with severely reduced kidney function, then record a treatment modification decision."

Claude calls:

1. `find_precedents(scenario="metformin with eGFR below 30", max_results=5)`
2. `record_decision(category="treatment_modification", scenario="eGFR 28, current metformin 1000mg BD", reasoning="eGFR 28 is below the 30 mL/min/1.73m2 absolute contraindication threshold per BNF and NICE NG28", outcome="discontinue_metformin_switch_to_gliclazide", confidence=0.97, decision_maker="clinical_ai_v2")`
3. `get_causal_chain(direction="upstream")` — surfaces the guideline node that drove the decision
4. `export_graph(format="json-ld")` — produces the decision graph for MDT review

The graph captures the decision, its guideline basis, and the causal chain — all retrievable for regulatory audit.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Banking — Risk/Compliance">

Credit risk teams use the MCP server to record every lending decision with its reasoning chain, surface regulatory precedents, and export compliance graphs for Basel III model governance review.

**Credit analyst prompt:**
> "Record a conditional mortgage approval for APP-2025-994421 (LTV 78%, DSTI 38%, credit score 714), find the three most similar past approvals, and return the causal chain for this decision."

Claude calls:

1. `record_decision(category="mortgage_origination", scenario="LTV 78%, DSTI 38%, credit score 714, first-time buyer", reasoning="LTV within 80% cap; DSTI 38% under stressed rate scenario breaches 35% guideline — conditional approval with LMI requirement", outcome="approved_conditional_lmi", confidence=0.89, decision_maker="credit_model_v3")`
2. `find_precedents(scenario="mortgage approval borderline DSTI stress test", max_results=3)`
3. `get_causal_chain(decision_id="...", direction="upstream", max_depth=5)`
4. `export_graph(format="turtle")` — produces the decision provenance graph for model governance committee

The result is a fully auditable credit decision trail with precedent links, ready for SR 11-7 model risk governance review.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Treating MCP as an HTTP server**: Do not try to `curl` the MCP server or look for a port number. It communicates via `stdin/stdout` and waits for JSON-RPC messages from the parent AI client.
- **Using relative paths for `SEMANTICA_KG_PATH`**: Because the AI client spawns the server as a subprocess, the working directory can be unpredictable. Always use absolute paths (e.g., `C:\Users\Name\graph.json` or `/Users/name/graph.json`) to avoid losing your data.
- **Virtual environment PATH issues**: If you installed Semantica inside a Python virtual environment, Claude Desktop will not automatically find `semantica-mcp` on the global system PATH. You must provide the absolute path to the binary in the `"command"` field.
- **Expecting remote hosting support**: Stdio-based MCP servers must run on the same local machine as the AI client. Remote execution over a network is not supported.
- **Confusing MCP integration with `AgentContext`**: If you are writing your own Python code to orchestrate an LLM, do not use the MCP server. Use the `AgentContext` class natively within your code.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Server does not appear in Claude Desktop** — fully quit and reopen Claude Desktop after editing the config (closing the window is not enough). Verify the binary is on PATH: `which semantica-mcp` on Unix, `where semantica-mcp` on Windows. If using a virtualenv, use the absolute binary path in `"command"`. Set `SEMANTICA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` and check stderr for startup errors.

**Graph data not persisting between sessions** — set `SEMANTICA_KG_PATH` to an absolute file path. Without it, the graph is in-memory only and resets on every server restart.

**Tool calls returning empty results** — `get_graph_summary` returning `"node_count": 0` means the graph is empty. Populate it via `add_entity` and `add_relationship`, or run `extract_entities` on text first and then `add_entity` for each result.

**Permission errors on `SEMANTICA_KG_PATH`** — the server process needs read/write access to the file and its parent directory. If running inside Docker, verify the volume mount and file ownership.
