Contributions of all kinds are welcome (code, documentation, tests, and community support). Every contribution is recognized in release notes and the GitHub contributors list.


## Quick Start

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantica.git
cd semantica
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

First-time contributors can start with [`good-first-issue`](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/labels/good-first-issue) labeled tickets, which are scoped to be completable in a few hours without deep codebase knowledge.


## Ways to Contribute

- **Code**: fix bugs, implement features, optimize performance, or add new ingestors, parsers, and exporters using the plugin registry.
- **Documentation**: fix typos, improve clarity, add missing examples, write tutorials, or keep the API reference accurate as modules evolve.
- **Testing**: add test coverage for untested modules or edge cases, reproduce reported bugs with minimal repros, or improve cross-platform reliability.
- **Community**: answer questions in GitHub Issues and Discussions, review pull requests with constructive feedback, or share Semantica in blog posts and talks.


## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantica.git
cd semantica
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**Code style tools:**

```bash
pytest                      # full test suite
black semantica/ tests/     # auto-format
isort semantica/ tests/     # sort imports
flake8 semantica/           # lint
```

Style conventions: **Black** for formatting, **isort** for imports, **flake8** for linting. All three run in CI.


## Reporting Issues

**Bug reports** should include:

- What happened vs. what you expected
- Minimal steps to reproduce
- Your environment: Python version, OS, Semantica version (`python -c "import semantica; print(semantica.__version__)"`)

**Feature requests** should include:

- Your concrete use case
- What you'd like Semantica to do
- Why it benefits a broad set of users, not just your specific workflow
