<Tip>
  Building something with Semantica? [Submit it on GitHub](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/issues/new?template=community_project.md): we'd love to feature it here.
</Tip>

Semantica is used across academia, enterprise, and independent research. Below is a snapshot of the ecosystem being built by the community.


## Projects Using Semantica

### Research & Academia

Teams in academia are using Semantica to build structured, auditable knowledge from unstructured scientific literature.

- **Academic literature mapping**: citation graph construction across multi-year corpora with temporal provenance
- **Biomedical knowledge graphs**: connecting genes, proteins, drugs, and diseases from PubMed and preprint feeds
- **Social network analysis**: community detection and influence analysis over entity-linked interaction graphs
- **Computational linguistics**: coreference resolution pipelines with entity-linked output for downstream NLP tasks

### Enterprise & Industry

Production deployments span regulated and high-stakes industries where AI accountability is not optional.

- **Business intelligence**: corporate knowledge bases built from filings, reports, and internal documentation
- **Cybersecurity & threat intelligence**: adversary attribution graphs, CVE-linked threat feeds, incident timelines
- **Healthcare & clinical AI**: patient safety graphs, drug interaction knowledge bases, HIPAA-compliant audit trails
- **Financial services**: fraud detection graphs, regulatory compliance pipelines (SOX/GDPR/MiFID II), risk lineage
- **Legal & compliance**: contract analysis pipelines, regulatory change tracking, evidence-backed research graphs
- **Critical infrastructure**: supply chain risk graphs, energy grid event graphs, logistics provenance

### Independent & Open Source

- **GraphRAG toolkits**: custom retrieval layers built on top of Semantica's `context` + `vector_store` modules
- **Domain-specific extractors**: NER and relation extractors for clinical, legal, and scientific text
- **Temporal graph dashboards**: visual timelines built with Semantica's `TemporalKnowledgeGraph` + custom visualization adapters

## Community Extensions

The plugin system (`PluginRegistry`) makes it easy to add new capabilities without touching core code. The community has built:

- **Custom entity extractors**: domain-specific NER for clinical entities, legal clause types, and financial instruments
- **Export adapters**: specialized serialization formats for proprietary industry systems
- **Ingestor plugins**: adapters for SharePoint, Notion, Confluence, and custom databases
- **Visualization plugins**: enhanced dashboards with Plotly, D3.js, and custom graph renderers
- **Evaluation harnesses**: domain-specific precision/recall benchmarks using `semantica.evals`


## Build Your Own Extension

Any Semantica component can be extended via the registry pattern:

```python
from semantica.ingest.registry import method_registry

def my_ingestor(source):
    return [{"text": "...", "metadata": {}, "source": source}]

method_registry.register("file", "my_format", my_ingestor)
```

See [Architecture](/architecture#extension-points) for the full extension guide.
