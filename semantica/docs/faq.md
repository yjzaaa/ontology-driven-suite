## General

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What is Semantica?" icon="info-circle">

Semantica is an open-source framework for building context graphs and decision intelligence layers for AI. It transforms unstructured data (documents, APIs, databases) into structured knowledge graphs with full provenance tracking, making AI systems explainable and auditable.

It's not a replacement for LangChain or LlamaIndex. It's the **accountability layer** that goes on top: recording decisions, tracing facts to sources, and making reasoning transparent.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What can I build with Semantica?" icon="hammer">

- Knowledge graphs from documents and multi-source data
- GraphRAG systems with graph-grounded retrieval and source attribution
- AI agents with structured decision history and semantic memory
- Compliance-ready pipelines with W3C PROV-O lineage (HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, FDA 21 CFR Part 11)
- Temporal graphs that track how facts change over time
- Ontology-driven knowledge bases with SHACL validation

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What makes Semantica different from LangChain or LlamaIndex?" icon="scale-balanced">

Most frameworks stop at retrieval or generation. Semantica adds an **accountability layer**: every decision is recorded, every fact links to a source, and every reasoning step is explainable. It's designed for environments where you need to audit *why* an AI reached a conclusion, not just what it said.

Semantica works alongside these frameworks, not against them.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Semantica explain an LLM's internal reasoning or chain-of-thought?" icon="triangle-exclamation">

No. This is **system-level explainability, not foundation-model explainability**. Semantica does not expose, reconstruct, or explain what happens *inside* the LLM/foundation model. Its internal reasoning or chain-of-thought stays opaque, as it does for any external system.

What Semantica explains is *outside* the model: what context and data were used, what decision was produced, the provenance behind it, the relevant relationships, the policies applied, and the resulting decision trail.

In short, Semantica explains and audits *what the AI system did*, not the foundation model's private internal reasoning.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Semantica free?" icon="tag">

Yes: MIT licensed, no vendor lock-in, no paywalled features. Some capabilities require third-party API keys (e.g., OpenAI embeddings, Groq inference), but Semantica itself is always free and open source.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the latest version?" icon="star">

**v0.6.8**: released September 2026.

Highlights: every release is now cryptographically signed (SLSA build provenance + Sigstore, closing the OpenSSF Scorecard Signed-Releases gap), real vector-store enumeration (`scan_vectors()`/`iter_vectors()`) across FAISS/SQLiteVec/PgVector/Qdrant/Weaviate/Milvus making `store migrate` functional, first-class Anthropic/Gemini/Ollama/DeepSeek/Novita LLM provider wrappers, a CI-friendly ontology quality gate, and 35 correctness fixes. The 0.6.x line also added first-class LangChain and CrewAI support and the Semantica RDF vocabulary with deterministic IRIs. See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for the full history.

```bash
pip install --upgrade semantica
```

## Installation

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How do I install Semantica?" icon="download">

```bash
pip install semantica
```

See [Installation](/installation) for virtual environment setup, optional extras (`[gpu]`, `[all]`, provider-specific), and platform-specific troubleshooting.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What Python version do I need?" icon="python">

Python **3.8 or higher**. Python 3.11+ is recommended for best performance and compatibility.

</Accordion>

This includes PyTorch with CUDA, FAISS GPU, and CuPy.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does Semantica handle large datasets?" icon="layer-group">

- **Parallel processing**: the `semantica.pipeline` module can run independent, parallel-safe steps in the same dependency layer concurrently (see the [Pipeline guide](/guides/pipeline))
- **Delta processing**: update graphs incrementally without full recompute on new data
- **Persistent backends**: swap in-memory NetworkX for Neo4j, FalkorDB, or Apache AGE for large-scale production graphs

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is Temporal Intelligence?" icon="clock">

`TemporalKnowledgeGraph` attaches `valid_from` / `valid_until` windows to nodes and edges, enabling point-in-time queries and historical analysis. Supports all 13 Allen interval algebra relations and OWL-Time export.

```python
from semantica.kg import TemporalKnowledgeGraph

tkg = TemporalKnowledgeGraph()
tkg.add_temporal_triple("A", "caused", "B", valid_from="2024-01", valid_until="2024-06")
snapshot = tkg.query_at_time("2024-03")
```

Available since v0.4.0.

```bash
pip install --upgrade semantica
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'semantica'" icon="xmark-circle">

Ensure the correct Python environment is active:

```bash
pip list | grep semantica
pip install --upgrade semantica
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Installation fails with dependency errors" icon="xmark-circle">

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip wheel
pip install semantica
```

If `[all]` fails on Windows, install extras individually instead.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Memory errors during processing" icon="memory">

Reduce batch sizes, enable streaming ingestion, or switch to a persistent graph backend:

```python
from semantica.graph_store import FalkorDBStore
store   = FalkorDBStore(host="localhost", port=6379)
builder = GraphBuilder(merge_entities=True, graph_store=store)
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Slow embedding or inference" icon="gauge-high">

Install GPU support and confirm CUDA is available:

```bash
pip install "semantica[gpu]"
nvidia-smi  # confirm GPU is visible
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unicode / cp1252 crash on Windows" icon="windows">

Fixed in **v0.5.0**. Upgrade, or set the encoding environment variable for older versions:

```bash
pip install --upgrade semantica
# or for older versions:
set PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
```
