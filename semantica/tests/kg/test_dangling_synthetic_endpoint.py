"""Tests for reconciling synthetic relation endpoints into the graph.

Relation extraction synthesizes ``UNKNOWN`` entities for endpoints that are
absent from the NER entity list, but ``GraphBuilder._process_item`` kept only
the endpoint string. The resulting graph then failed ``GraphValidator`` with
``DANGLING_EDGE``. See issue #1463.
