# CVE-2026-14456 (OpenSSL QUIC-server DoS, flagged against this base image's
# openssl/libssl3t64/openssl-provider-legacy): the Debian fix
# (3.5.7-1~deb13u2) is only in trixie-proposed-updates as of this writing,
# not yet promoted to trixie-security, so there's no package to pin here
# today. Deliberately NOT running `apt-get upgrade` to chase it - that
# breaks build reproducibility (terrascan AC_DOCKER_0052) and still
# wouldn't reach a proposed-updates-only package. Once Debian ships the fix
# and rebuilds this tag, the docker Dependabot ecosystem in
# .github/dependabot.yml opens a PR bumping the digest pin above. Also: this
# image only serves plain HTTP via uvicorn and never opens a QUIC listener,
# so the bug isn't reachable here regardless.
#
# Pinned to 3.13, NOT 3.14: #1290 bumped this to python:3.14-slim and broke
# the build outright (Container Security Scan, every run since) - gensim
# (a base, non-extras-gated dependency) ships no cp314 wheel on PyPI yet, so
# pip falls back to building it from source, which needs a C compiler this
# slim image doesn't carry ("error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
# 'gcc'"). Revisit the 3.14 bump once gensim (and anything else pulled in
# transitively) publishes cp314 wheels - check with
# `pip index versions gensim` / the project's PyPI files page, not just
# whether `uv pip compile` resolves (resolution only reads sdist metadata,
# it doesn't attempt the build that fails here).

# explorer-extra-py313.txt is `uv pip compile pyproject.toml --extra explorer
# --python-version 3.13 --constraint requirements-ci.txt --generate-hashes`
# (see ci.yml's explorer-extra-py311.txt for the CI counterpart, resolved
# for CI's python 3.11 instead - the two aren't interchangeable: audioread
# (via librosa) needs standard-aifc/standard-sunau only on python>=3.13,
# since aifc/sunau left stdlib there, so a 3.11-resolved lockfile is
# missing hashes pip needs on this image's actual 3.13 interpreter and
# --require-hashes fails outright rather than silently under-pinning).
# Every fetched package is hash-verified (Scorecard Pinned-Dependencies)
# and pinned to the same versions CI audited, e.g. msgpack==1.2.1 and
# setuptools==84.0.0 (which also replaces the base image's vulnerable
# 70.3.0, CVE-2025-47273 - nothing else in the tree pulls a newer copy).
# --no-deps on the local package itself: it's our own source tree, not a
# fetch, so there's nothing to hash-pin there - but `pip install .` still
# does a PEP 517 build, which by default creates an *isolated* build env
# and fetches [build-system] requires (setuptools, wheel) completely
# outside any hash checking. pep517-build.txt pins that exact
# build-system.requires; installing it first and passing
# --no-build-isolation makes pip reuse those hash-verified copies instead
# of fetching its own.
