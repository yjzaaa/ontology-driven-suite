"""Regression tests for DNS check-then-use (TOCTOU) hardening in the
ontology URL fetcher (GHSA-8c7v-62gr-hj6g's secondary "smaller" gap).

`_validate_fetch_url` resolves and validates a hostname once; if the actual
HTTP client resolved it again independently at connect time, a low-TTL or
rebinding DNS answer could differ between the two lookups, reopening the
SSRF window the validation exists to close. `_make_pinned_session` closes
this by pinning the connection pool's `host` directly to the already-
validated IP (bypassing DNS resolution for the connection entirely), while
explicitly restoring the real hostname as the outgoing HTTP `Host` header
and, for HTTPS, the TLS SNI `server_hostname` / `assert_hostname` — so the
connection reaches the pinned IP but still presents (and verifies against)
the original hostname's identity.

test_ontology_ssrf.py covers the redirect-handling logic around this with
mocks; this file proves the pinning mechanism itself works end-to-end
against real local servers, with no DNS mocking at all — the test hostname
is never resolved, which is exactly the property being verified. It also
includes a negative control (mismatched cert hostname) proving TLS
verification is genuinely enforced against the real hostname, not silently
bypassed or checked against the pinned IP instead.
