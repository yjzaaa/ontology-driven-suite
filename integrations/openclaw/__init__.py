Semantica × OpenClaw Integration
==================================

First-class integration between the Semantica semantic intelligence stack and
`OpenClaw <https://openclaw.ai>`_ — the open-source personal AI agent platform.

OpenClaw connects to external tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol).  This
integration exposes the full Semantica MCP surface (15 tools, 3 resources) to
any OpenClaw agent and also ships a lightweight ``OpenClawKGTool`` that can be
dropped directly into an OpenClaw SOUL.md tool-list as a native tool.

Public surface
--------------
OpenClawKGTool      — Thin wrapper around the Semantica REST API usable as an
                       OpenClaw native tool (no MCP gateway required)
OpenClawMCPConfig   — Helper that emits the ``mcporter.json`` snippet needed to
                       wire Semantica's MCP server into an OpenClaw gateway

Quick start
-----------
    pip install semantica

    >>> from integrations.openclaw import OpenClawKGTool, OpenClawMCPConfig
    >>> print(OpenClawMCPConfig().to_json())   # paste into mcporter.json
    >>> tool = OpenClawKGTool(base_url="http://localhost:8000")
    >>> result = tool.extract("OpenClaw is an open-source AI agent framework.")

MCP quick start
---------------
Run the Semantica MCP server once::

    python -m semantica.mcp_server

Then add the printed config snippet to your OpenClaw ``mcporter.json`` and
restart the OpenClaw Gateway::

    openclaw gateway restart

All 15 Semantica tools are then available as native OpenClaw agent tools.

Compatibility
-------------
Requires ``semantica >= 0.3.0``.  The MCP path requires ``python >= 3.8`` and
a running ``semantica.mcp_server`` instance.  The REST path requires a running
``semantica.server`` instance (``python -m semantica.server``, port 8000 by
default).
